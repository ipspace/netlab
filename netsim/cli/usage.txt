            Vagrantfile, hosts.yml and ansible.cfg. This command can also be
            used to create graph specifications or output transformed topology 
            in YAML or JSON format.

restart     Restart the lab (netlab down followed by netlab up) using the
            transformed lab topology in the netlab snapshot file

Configuring and Controlling the Lab

connect     Connect to network devices using SSH or 'docker exec'

collect     Collect device configurations from network devices and save them in
            specified directory

down        Destroy the virtual lab

Reports and graphs
==================
status      Display the state of lab instances running on the current server

report      Create a report based on transfomed lab topology data

graph       Create a graph description in Graphviz or D2 format

inspect     Helps you inspect data structures in transformed lab topology

show        Display system settings

Device configuration commands
=============================
initial     Runs initial-config Ansible playbook to deploy initial- and module-
            specific configurations to network devices, or to create a directory
            with initial device configurations

config      Use a custom configuration template to configure network devices

Notes:

install     Runs installation scripts to install nice-to-have Ubuntu software,
            Ansible and vagrant/libvirt

test        Tests libvirt or VirtualBox installation by building a 3-router
            virtual lab using Cumulus VX

libvirt     Build Vagrant boxes for vagrant-libvirt provider

version     Prints the version of netlab package

Provider-specific commands
