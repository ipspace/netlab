Usage:

    netlab <command> <parameters>

High-level commands
===================

up          Create virtualization provider and network automation configuration
            files, start the virtual lab, and deploy initial device configurations

down        Destroy the virtual lab

restart     Restart the lab (netlab down followed by netlab up) using the
            transformed lab topology in the netlab snapshot file

Topology manipulation commands
==============================

create      Create virtualization provider and network automation configuration
            file. Assuming you're using Vagrant and Ansible, it creates
            Vagrantfile, hosts.yml and ansible.cfg. This command can also be
            used to create graph specifications or output transformed topology 
            in YAML or JSON format.

Device configuration commands
=============================

initial     Runs initial-config Ansible playbook to deploy initial- and module-
            specific configurations to network devices, or to create a directory
            with initial device configurations

connect     Connect to network devices using SSH or 'docker exec'

config      Use a custom configuration template to configure network devices

collect     Collect device configurations from network devices and save them in
            specified directory

Notes:
* Device configuration commands require Ansible version 2.9 or higher

Convenience commands
====================

install     Runs installation scripts to install nice-to-have Ubuntu software,
            Ansible and vagrant/libvirt
test        Tests libvirt or VirtualBox installation by building a 3-router
            virtual lab using Cumulus VX
alias       Create aliases for old netsim-tools CLI commands
read        Read network topology data and output the results
            (used mostly for troubleshooting)
version     Prints the version of netlab package
