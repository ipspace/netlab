status      Display the state of lab instances running on the current server

report      Create a report based on transfomed lab topology data

graph       Create a graph description in Graphviz or D2 format

inspect     Helps you inspect data structures in transformed lab topology

show        Display system settings

usage       Display, manage and clear usage statistics
