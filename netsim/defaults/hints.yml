evpn:
  irb_group: >
    All VLANs that are part of a VRF using asymmetric IRB have to be present on all nodes
    using that VRF. The easiest way to achieve that is to create a group with all
    participating nodes and list VLANs in the 'vlans' attribute of that group
  node_bundle: |
    evpn.bundle attribute can be used only in global VRF definition
  asn: >
    You could use the global 'bgp.as' parameter to specify the AS to use in EVPN
    route targets. 'bgp.as' specified on individual nodes or groups will not work. You
    can also specify the global AS used by EVPN in 'vrf.as' parameter if you use
    VRFs, or in 'evpn.as' parameter if you use EVPN in bridging-only scenarios.
bgp:
  igp: >
    Add a supported IGP (ospf, isis, eigrp) to the list of modules.
report:
  source: >
    A report can be specified in a file with .j2 suffix within 'reports' subdirectory in
    package-, system-, user- or current directory. You can also specify a report in a
    defaults.outputs.report setting.
quirks:
  junos_lb: >
    Junos devices cannot have more than one loopback interface per routing instance

vrf:
  inactive: >
    A globally-defined VRF is not used on a node unless that node is attached to a VRF link,
    or has the VRF listed in the node 'vrfs' dictionary and uses VRF loopbacks.

cli:
  recreate:
    netlab transforms lab topology into device- and platform data and stores the results in
    a snapshot file that is used by most netlab commands. Changes to source files (including
    lab topology or defaults) are not automatically reflected in the snapshot file.
    Use 'netlab create' or 'netlab up' to create a new snapshot file.
  interrupt:
    Use 'netlab status' command to display the status of your lab and 'netlab
    down --cleanup' command to clean it up. You might have to use the '--force'
    option of the 'netlab down' command.

routing:
  policy:
    match_af:
      A routing policy 'match.prefix' condition can match a single address
      family. Use 'match.af' parameter to specify the address family you want to
      match.

validation:
  nodes:
    A test that uses 'show', 'exec' or 'plugin' action must specify the nodes on
    which that action will be executed.
  valid:
    A test that includes the 'valid' check must generate some output to check. That
    output can be generated with 'show','exec', or 'suzieq' action.
  show:
    The 'show' action should return structured data that is then validated with the
    'valid' check. If you want to execute a command on the device without checking
    the results, use the 'exec' action.
