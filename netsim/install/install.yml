    epilog: |
      * You might need to log out and log in to start using netlab with libvirt.
      * Use 'netlab test libvirt' command to test your installation

  containerlab:
    description: Docker and containerlab
    distro: [ ubuntu, debian ]
    uses: [ apt ]
    intro: |
      This script installs Docker and containerlab on a Debian or Ubuntu
      system. The script was tested on Debian 12 (bookworm) and Ubuntu 20.04,
      22.04, and 24.04.
    epilog: |
      * Log out and back in to start using netlab with containerlab/Docker
      * Use 'netlab test clab' command to test your installation

  ansible:
    description: Ansible and prerequisite Python libraries
    uses: [ pip ]
    intro: |
      This script installs Ansible and related Python3 packages required to run
      netlab Ansible playbooks. The script was tested on Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04,
      and 24.04, and Debian 12 (bookworm), and should work on other Linux
      distributions as well.

      The script assumes that you already set up Python3 environment. If that's
      not the case, please run "netlab install ubuntu" first.

  grpc:
    description: GRPC libraries and Nokia GRPC Ansible collection
    uses: [ pip ]
    intro: |
      This script installs Nokia Ansible Galaxy GRPC plug-in and related Python3
      packages. The script was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 but should work on any
      Linux system with Ansible and pip3.

      The script assumes that you already set up Python3 environment and
      installed Ansible. If that's not the case, please run "netlab install
      ubuntu" or "netlab install ansible" first.
    epilog:
      To test the installation, run 'netlab test grpc'

  graph:
    description: GraphViz and D2 software
    uses: [ apt ]
    intro: |
      This script installs GraphViz and D2 software needed to generate graphs
      from the netlab topologies.

      While GraphViz is available as a Ubuntu package and installed with apt, D2
      expects you to run a shell script downloaded from the Internet. That's
      probably OK for a test server or a throwaway VM, but you might not want to
      do that on a server that is supposed to be secure.

shared:
  intro: |
    The script is set to abort on first error. If the installation completes
    you're probably OK even though you might have seen errors during the
    installation process.
