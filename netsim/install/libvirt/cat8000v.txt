Checking initial configuration of Cisco Catalyst 8000v
======================================================

The initial configuration is applied from a CDROM file. All you have to do is a
sanity check:

* Wait for the boot process to end
* Log in with user 'vagrant', password 'vagrant'
* Examine the startup configuration and check that it contains the MGMT VRF
* Disconnect from console (ctrl-] usually works).
