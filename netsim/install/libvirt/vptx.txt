Creating initial configuration for Juniper vPTX (vJunos EVO)
===============================================

Initial configuration for the vPTX device is prepared in a bootstrap disk image (pre-install hook).
After the system boots and displays the 'login' prompt:

* Login with username 'vagrant' and password 'Vagrant'
  (it might take a while for the username to be recognized)
* Verify that the VM got a management IP address with 
  'show interfaces terse | match re0'
* Verify that the FPC 0 is online with 
  'show chassis fpc'
* Shut down the VM with 'request system power-off' (confirm with 'yes')

NOTES:
* The management traffic is isolated in a dedicated management VRF (mgmt_junos).
