The OpenBSD box-creation process is fully automated with cloud-init.
The virtual machine will boot, set password for user 'openbsd' and
execute commands specified in the cloud-init user configuration file.

The last command executed is 'shutdown -h -p now' which powers off the
VM, allowing 'netlab libvirt package' to continue with box packaging.
