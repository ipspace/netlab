Finalizing the OpenBSD box-creation process
===============================================

After the boot process completes and you get the 'login' prompt:

* Login with username 'openbsd' and password 'Vagrant'
* Verify that the VM got a management IP address with 'ifconfig'
* Execute 'sudo shutdown -h -p now' to shut down and poweroff the VM
