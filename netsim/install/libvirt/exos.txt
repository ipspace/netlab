Creating initial configuration for Extreme EXOS Vagrant box
===========================================================

* Wait for the 'login' prompt and 'Authentication Service (AAA) on the
  master node is now available for login' message
* Login as 'admin' (no password)

Answers the never-ending list of setup questions:

* Disable auto-provision: yes
* Management port: skip
* Disable MSTP: no
* Enable enhanced security: no
* Disable Telnet: yes
* Enable SNMPv2: no
* Enable SNMPv3: no
* Turn off unconfigured ports by default: yes
* Failsave username/password: no

When you get to the end of the list, you can see the CLI commands you just
generated and a list of generally useful commands. After that, you'll eventually
get to the EXOS prompt (* EXOS-VM.1):

Type in these commands (there will be extra prompts, so don't just copy/paste
everything). Skip the text in brackets -- that's the explanation.

* configure account admin password (old password is empty, new one is admin)
* enable ssh
* unconfigure vlan Mgmt ip         (remove current IP from management VLAN)
* enable dhcp vlan Mgmt            (enable DHCP on management VLAN)
* save configuration

Disconnect from the console (ctrl-] usually works).
