The devices under test are simple bridges with a VLAN trunk between
them. Both VLANs are using the same IP prefix to identify potential
inter-VLAN leaking.

* h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
* h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
* h1 should not be able to reach h3
* h5 should not be able to reach h6 over its untagged native vlan

Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
STP learning phase
