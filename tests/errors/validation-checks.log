MissingValue in validation: Test f1 should have wait, show, exec, plugin, or suzieq option
IncorrectValue in validation: You cannot use show,exec in test f2. Use only one action per test
IncorrectValue in validation: Test f3 must specify the nodes to execute the test on
... A test that uses 'show', 'exec' or 'plugin' action must specify the nodes on which
    that action will be executed.
MissingValue in validation: Test f4 has a "show" option but no "valid" option
... The 'show' action should return structured data that is then validated with the
    'valid' check. If you want to execute a command on the device without checking the
    results, use the 'exec' action.
MissingValue in validation: Test f5 has a "valid" option but no action that would generate data to check
... A test that includes the 'valid' check must generate some output to check. That output
    can be generated with 'show','exec', or 'suzieq' action.
