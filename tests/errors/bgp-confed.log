IncorrectValue in bgp: Confederation member AS 65001 (part of AS 65000) is itself also a confederation AS
IncorrectValue in bgp: Confederation member 65002 is in confederations 65001 and 65000
... While that's a valid BGP design, netlab does not support it
MissingValue in bgp: Confederation AS 65100 needs at least one member ASN
IncorrectValue in bgp: Node r1 is using confederation ASN 65000
... BGP speakers can use only confederation member ASNs, not the confederation ASN
IncorrectType in bgp: Node r3 (device frr) uses member ASN 65003 of confederation AS 65000
... Device frr does not support BGP confederations
Fatal error in netlab: Cannot proceed beyond this point due to errors, exiting
