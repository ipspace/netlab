defaults.vxlan.start_vni: 20000

message: |
  This test case builds a leaf-and-spine fabric with VLAN-over-VXLAN
  bridging, with centralized IRB on leaf1. The leaf switches are doing VLAN/VXLAN encap/decap, the
  spine switches are IP routers running OSPF, BGP, and EVPN.

  Assuming the 'vxlan-bridging' test case succeeded, this test case
  validates that the EVPN route reflectors, MTU settings and Centralized IRB.

  * all hosts should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase

  To change the devices under test, use netlab up -d parameter
