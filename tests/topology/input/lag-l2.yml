#
defaults:
  provider: clab
  device: dellos10

module: [lag, stp, vlan]

addressing:
  p2p:
    ipv4: False

nodes:
  r1:

  r2:
    lag.lacp: slow     # Test node level lag attribute

links:
- mtu: 1600            # Test that MTU is copied to member links
  lag.members: [r1-r2, r1-r2]
  stp.enable: false    # STP parameters apply to port-channel, not member links

- lag:
    members: [r1-r2, r1-r2]
    lacp: slow         # Link level override

- lag:
    members:
    - r1:
      r2:
        lag.lacp: fast # Interface level override
    - r1:
      r2:
        lag.lacp: fast # Interface level override (one suffices, last one wins)
