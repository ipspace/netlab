# Anycast gateway on a physical interface
#

message: |
  This test case replaces a multi-access LAN with a VLAN -- the switches have anycast
  IP address configured on the shared LAN. Two LANs are used in the topology to explore
  the impact of shared MAC addresses on multiple LANs.

  Static routes on hosts point to the shared anycast IP address. The switches
  are running OSPF with a third switch to enable network-wide connectivity.

  All hosts should be able to ping the loopback addresses of all switches.
