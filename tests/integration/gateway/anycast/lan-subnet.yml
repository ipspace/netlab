# Anycast gateway on a physical interface
#

message: |
  This is the simplest anycast gateway test case. The switches have only anycast
  IP address configured on the shared LAN. Static routes on hosts point to the
  shared anycast IP address.

  The switches are running OSPF over another interface to allow pings from hosts
  to loopback switch addresses.

  All four nodes should be able to ping each other.
