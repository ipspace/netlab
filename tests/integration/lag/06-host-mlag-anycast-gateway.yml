  The device under is a pair of switches with a pair of L3 MLAG links connected to 2 Linux hosts, each connected through a LAG
  The hosts should be able to ping each other and their anycast gateway

groups:
  _auto_create: True
  switches:
    members: [ s1, s2 ]
    module: [ lag, vlan, gateway ]
  hosts:
    members: [ h1, h2 ]
    module: [ lag ]     # Host side must support lag to present single MAC on both interfaces
    device: frr         # linux does not support 'lag' module yet

vlans:
  red:
   gateway.protocol: anycast

links:
- lag:
   members: [ s1-s2 ]
   mlag.peergroup: 1
  # On OS10 in case of mlag, vlan.trunk is implied for all vlans - other platforms?
- lag:
