  The device under test are two pairs of switches, interconnected through
  dual-sided MLAG links each carrying a different set of vlans.
  This illustrates the need for 'split_dual_mlag_link' in the lag module.

  The devices are only pairwise adjacent in OSPF, a1-a2 and b1-b2

  The hosts should be able to ping each other and various gateways
