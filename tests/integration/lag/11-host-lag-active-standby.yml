  The device under test is a pair of switches with a pair of links connected to 2 Linux hosts.
  The Linux hosts are using active-standby lags, which don't require any special support from the switches
  
  The hosts should be able to ping each other and their gateway

lag.mode: active-backup

groups:
  _auto_create: True
  switches:
    members: [ s1, s2 ]
    module: [ vlan ]    # No 'lag' module support enabled
  hosts:
    members: [ h1, h2 ]
    module: [ lag ]     # Host side uses lag to implement active/standby bond
