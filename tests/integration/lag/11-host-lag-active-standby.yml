  The device under test is a pair of switches with a pair of links connected to 2 Linux hosts.
  The Linux hosts are using active-standby lags, which don't require any special support from the switches

  The hosts should be able to ping each other and their gateway

lag.mode: active-backup

  _auto_create: true
  switches:
    members: [s1, s2]
    module: [vlan]      # No 'lag' module support enabled
  hosts:
