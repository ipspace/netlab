message: |
  Use this topology to test the DHCPv4 client on your device. Use 'netlab
  validate' to check whether your devices requested DHCP leases from the DHCP
  server.

  If your client suppors configurable 'router option' requests to generate
  a default route, check that C1 has a default route but C2 does not.
