  The tested device (DUT) is a PE-router. It runs IS-IS and SR-MPLS in an
  IPv6-only network and has an IBGP session with another PE-router. It has to
  perform IP-to-MPLS encapsulation to get the traffic across the BGP-free MPLS
  core.

  The validation test checks end-to-end connectivity across a BGP-free MPLS core
  between a set of linux hosts attached to the PE-routers.
