  The devices under test are VLAN-to-VXLAN layer-3 switches connecting a VLAN
  stretched across VXLAN transport and two edge subnets.

  The test case verifies that you can use VXLAN-enabled VLANs in VRFs and that
  your device runs OSPF across VXLAN-enabled VLANs.

  All hosts should be able to ping each other.

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase.
