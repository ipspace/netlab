  This is the multi-node version of the vxlan-bridging lab.
  Use it to check that you don't have spanning tree problems
  in VXLAN overlay

  * h1, h2 and h3 should be able to ping each other
  * h4, h5 and h6 should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  OSPF adjacency establishment and STP learning phase
