  The devices under test are VLAN-to-VXLAN layer-3 switches connecting a VLAN
  stretched across VXLAN transport and two edge subnets.

  The test case verifies that you can use VXLAN-enabled VLANs in VRFs and that
  your device runs OSPF across VXLAN-enabled VLANs.

  * All hosts should be able to ping each other.
  * Switches should have OSPF adjacencies in the tenant VRF

  Notes:

  * It might take a while for the lab to work due to STP learning phase.
  * The validation tests don't check OSPF adjacencies
