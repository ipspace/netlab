  The devices under test are VLAN-to-VXLAN layer-3 switches between two access
  VLANs and two VXLAN VNIs. Both switches perform inter-VLAN bridging, resulting
  in asymmetrical IRB.

  All hosts should be able to ping each other and all switch loopback IPs

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase.
