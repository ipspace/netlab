  The devices under test are VLAN-to-VXLAN layer-3 switches between two access
  VLANs and two VXLAN VNIs. Both switches perform inter-VLAN bridging, resulting
  in asymmetrical IRB.

  All hosts should be able to ping each other and one of the switches' loopbacks
  (due to the way static routes are set on hosts).

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase.
