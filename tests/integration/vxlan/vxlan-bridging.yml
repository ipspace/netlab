  The devices under test are VLAN-to-VXLAN bridges between two access VLANs
  and two VXLAN VNIs. Both VLANs are using the same IP prefix to identify
  potential inter-VLAN leaking.

  * h1, h2 and h3 should be able to ping each other
  * h4 and h5 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h4 or h5

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase
