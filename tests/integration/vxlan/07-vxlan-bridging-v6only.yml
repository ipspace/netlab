  The devices under test are VLAN-to-VXLAN bridges running
  VXLAN between IPv6 endpoints. A single VLAN with two
  hosts is bridged between two switches

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  OSPF adjacency setup process and STP learning phase
