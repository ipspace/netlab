  The device under test has two VRFs with two interfaces in each VRF.
  Routers are attached to those interfaces and run OSPF with device under test.
  Assuming the multi-vrf test case succeeded, this one adds OSPF routing with
  CE routers.

  * r1 and r2 should be able to ping each other
  * r3 and r4 should be able to ping each other
  * r1 should not be able to reach r3
