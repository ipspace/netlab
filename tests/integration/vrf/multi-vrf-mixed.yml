  The device under test has two VRFs with two interfaces in each VRF.
  Routers are attached to those interfaces and run OSPF and BGP with
  device under test. Assuming the OSPF and BGP multi-vrf test cases
  succeeded, this one tests OSPF-to-BGP two-way redistribution.

  * r1 and r2 should be able to ping each other
  * r3 and r4 should be able to ping each other
  * r1 should not be able to reach r3
