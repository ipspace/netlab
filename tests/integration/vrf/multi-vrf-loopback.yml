  The device under test has two VRFs with two interfaces in each VRF.
  Each VRF has a loopback interface.

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other and the VRF loopback interface
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other and the VRF loopback interface
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3
