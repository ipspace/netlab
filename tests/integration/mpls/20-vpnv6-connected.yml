message:
  The tested device (DUT) is a PE-router running MPLS/VPN with two IPv6-only
  VRFs. The Linux hosts are attached directly to the PE-router.

  The PE-router has to run OSPF and LDP with a P-router and exchange VPNv6
  routes with another PE-router. The connected IPv6 subnets must be
  redistributed into VPNv6 AF for the end-to-end connectivity test to work.
