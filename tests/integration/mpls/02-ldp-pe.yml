message:
  The tested device (DUT) is a PE-router. It runs OSPF and LDP with a P-router
  and an IBGP session with another PE-router. It has to perform IP-to-MPLS
  encapsulation to get the traffic across the BGP-free MPLS core.

  The validation test checks end-to-end connectivity across a BGP-free MPLS core
  between a set of linux hosts attached to the PE-routers.
