message: |
  The tested device (DUT) is a PE-router running MPLS/VPN with two VRFs. The
  Linux hosts are attached directly to the PE-router.

  The PE-router has to run OSPF and LDP with a P-router and exchange VPNv4
  routes with another PE-router. The connected subnets must be redistributed
  into VPNv4 AF for the end-to-end connectivity test to work.
