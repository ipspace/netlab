message:
  The tested device (DUT) is a PE-router running MPLS/VPN and implementing
  common services VRF.

  The test checks the MPLS/VPN route import/export functionality. It should
  succeed if the simple MPLS/VPN test and the VRF Common Services test succeded
  unless you have to configure some weird nerd knobs to make it work.
