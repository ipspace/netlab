# A device has to support the following features to pass this test case:
#
# * Routed VLAN interfaces
# * VRFs
# * OSPF in VRFs
#
message: |
  VRF lite implementation with VLAN trunks
 
  * h1, h2, and h5 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP and OSPF setup phase
