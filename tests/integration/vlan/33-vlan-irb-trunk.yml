  The devices under test are layer-3 switches bridging
  between ports in the same VLAN and routing across VLANs

  * All hosts should be able to ping each other and
    switch interfaces in the same VLAN
  * Hosts should be able to ping loopback address of the
    adjacent switch (static routes point to nearest router)

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase
