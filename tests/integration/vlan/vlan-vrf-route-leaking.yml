#
# VRF lite implementation with VLAN trunks, including ebgp peering between vrfs locally
#
# * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other, as well as h3 and h4
# * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other, as well as h1 and h2
# 
# A device has to support the following features to pass this test case:
#
# * Routed VLAN interfaces
# * VRFs
# * OSPF in VRFs
# * BGP unnumbered using ipv6 lla
#
# Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
# STP and OSPF setup phase
