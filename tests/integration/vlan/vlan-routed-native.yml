  A router-on-a-stick is attached to a VLAN trunk and runs OSPF on all attached
  VLANs. One of the VLANs is a native VLAN between router-on-stick and switch.

  * r1, r2, and ros should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP and OSPF setup phase
