#
# The devices under test are simple bridges with a VLAN trunk
# between them. An external router is attached to one of them
#
# * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
#
# Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
# STP learning phase
#
# This test case requires #311 to be fixed to work correctly
