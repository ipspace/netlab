#
# The devices under test are layer-3 switches bridging
# between ports in the same VLAN and routing across VLANs
#
# * All hosts should be able to ping each other and
#   switch interfaces in the same VLAN
# * Hosts should be able to ping loopback address of s1
#   but loopback address of s2 (static routes on hosts point to s1)
#
# Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
# STP learning phase
