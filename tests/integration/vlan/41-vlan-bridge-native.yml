  The devices under test are simple bridges with a VLAN trunk between
  them. One of the trunk members is a native VLAN. Both VLANs are
  using the same IP prefix to identify potential inter-VLAN leaking.

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3
  * h5 should not be able to reach h6

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase
