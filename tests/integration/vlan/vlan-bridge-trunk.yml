  The devices under test are simple bridges with a VLAN trunk between
  them. Both VLANs are using the same IP prefix to identify potential
  inter-VLAN leaking.
  
  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase
