message: |
  The devices under test form a connected triangle (loop) with 2 VLANs.

  If STP is enabled, this topology requires per-VLAN STP (PVRST); the VLANs
  themselves don't form a loop, but the links do. Per-VLAN priority settings
  should make S1 root for red, and S2 for blue VLAN

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3

  For FRR, use
  ```docker exec -it clab-stp-s1 /usr/sbin/brctl showstp vlan1000``` and
  ```docker exec -it clab-stp-s2 /usr/sbin/brctl showstp vlan1001``` and
