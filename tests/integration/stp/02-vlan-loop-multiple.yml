  The devices under test form a connected triangle (loop) with 2 VLANs. 
  
  If STP is enabled, this topology requires per-VLAN STP (PVRST); the VLANs themselves don't form a loop, but the links do

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3
