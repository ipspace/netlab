  The devices under test form a connected triangle (loop) with 2 VLANs.

  Since the VLANs themselves don't form a loop, STP can be disabled (making sure
  untagged packets are disallowed using a trunk)

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3
