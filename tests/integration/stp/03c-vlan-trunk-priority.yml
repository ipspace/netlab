  The devices under test have multiple links between them which form a loop unless STP blocks all but one

  h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other, and no forwarding loop should occur

  The bridge with the highest priority (s2) should become the root, all but one
  port should get blocked by S1 in order of port priority For FRR, use ```docker
  exec -it clab-stp-s1 /usr/sbin/brctl showstp vlan1000``` to verify Cumulus:
  ```docker exec -it clab-stp-s1 /sbin/brctl showstp bridge``` cEOS: ```docker
  exec -it clab-stp-s2 Cli -c "show spanning-tree"``` Dell OS10: ```sshpass
  -padmin ssh admin@clab-stp-s1 "show spanning-tree vlan 1000"```

  Sample cEOS output:
