  The devices under test form a connected triangle (loop) without IP addresses
  in the red VLAN

  h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other, and no forwarding loop should occur

  The bridge with the highest priority (s1) should become the root, the link s2-s3 should get blocked
  Use ```docker exec -it clab-stp-s3 /usr/sbin/brctl showstp vlan1000``` to verify
