  The devices under test form a server cluster connected to a pair of ToR switches.
  Host facing ports are automatically configured as 'edge' ports, the inter-switch port is
  manually configured as 'network'

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3
