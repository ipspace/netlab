  This is a config-only test that uses all possible STP port types. It's a bit
  hard to validate whether a particular port type is configured ;), the only
  check we can do is for edge ports.

groups:
  _auto_create: True
  hosts:
    members: [ h1, h2, h3, h4 ]
    device: linux
    provider: clab
  switches:
    members: [ dut, x1 ]
    module: [ vlan, stp ]

validate:
  edge:                     # The only thing we can test is the edge port type
    wait: 3                 # It should be enabled in a few seconds
    nodes: [ h1 ]
    pass: H1 and H2 are connected to edge ports
    fail: H1 and H2 are probably connected to regular STP-controlled ports
