  This lab tests OSPF adjacencies on VLAN interfaces with non-default MTU
  settings. The adjacency establishment could fail due to MTU mismatch.

  Failure to establish X2-DUT adjacency means that the VLAN interface does not
  get the correct MTU. Failure to establish X1-DUT adjacency indicates a
  potential problem with system MTU.
