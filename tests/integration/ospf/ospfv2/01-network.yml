  This lab tests the OSPF network type and the default device MTU settings. The
  device under test has two interfaces with OSPF network type set to 'broadcast'
  and 'point-to-point'. It has to establish OSPF adjacencies over both.

  The adjacency establishment could fail due to network type mismatch (not
  likely on the 'broadcast' link) or due to MTU mismatch (in which case both
  adjacencies would fail).
