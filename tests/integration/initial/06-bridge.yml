  This scenario tests the basic "bridge" functionality. As a "bridge" is nothing
  more than a VLAN-capable node having all interfaces in VLAN 1, this test
  effectively:

  * Tests whether the device can take the role 'bridge'
  * Whether the interfaces are all configured in the same VLAN
  * Whether the device configuration template handles VLAN 1, or the device
    quirks take extra efforts to work around that
