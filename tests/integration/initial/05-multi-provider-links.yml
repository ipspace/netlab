  This scenario tests all possible multi-provider link scenarios. There are 4 main cases:
  1. Libvirt-libvirt => P2P UDP tunnel
  2. Clab-clab => P2P veth pair
  3. Libvirt-Clab => (NEW) tap interface connected to macvlan device from Clab
  4. 3 nodes or more => Linux bridge (slight variation in who creates it: all Clab->Clab, else Libvirt)

  The reason for introducing a new multi-provider interconnect construct, is that a Linux bridge (as currently used) blocks STP and LACP
