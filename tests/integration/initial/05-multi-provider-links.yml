  This scenario tests all possible multi-provider link scenarios. There are 4 main cases:
  1. Libvirt-libvirt => P2P UDP tunnel
  2. Clab-clab => P2P veth pair
  3. Libvirt-Clab => (NEW) tap interface connected to macvlan device from Clab
  4. 3 nodes or more => Linux bridge (slight variation in who creates it: all Clab->Clab, else Libvirt)

  The reason for introducing a new multi-provider interconnect construct, is that a Linux bridge (as currently used) blocks STP and LACP

provider: libvirt

groups:
  _auto_create: True

  libvirt:
    members: [libvirt_a,libvirt_b]
    device: cumulus_nvue

  clab:
    members: [clab_a,clab_b]
    device: frr
    provider: clab

links: 
- libvirt_a-libvirt_b  # libvirt-libvirt: p2p tunnel
- clab_a-clab_b        # clab-clab: veth pair
- libvirt_a-clab_a     # libvirt-clab p2p: macvlan to tap interface  ## FAILS ##
- libvirt_a:           # 3-node LAN: Linux bridge created by libvirt, external to clab in this case
