  This lab tests the RIPv2 passive interfaces. DUT has a passive interface on
  the link with X2, so the route from X2 to DUT should go over X1 (and have
  metric=3)

module: [ ripv2 ]

groups:
  probes:
    device: frr
    provider: clab
    members: [ x1, x2 ]

nodes:
  dut:
  x1:
  x2:

links:
- dut:                        # Circuitous link to X2
  x1:

- dut:                        # Direct link to X2
    ripv2.passive: True
  x2:

- x1:                         # Second leg of the circuitous link
  x2:

- dut:                        # A stub network in case we have to deal with stuff like FRR
