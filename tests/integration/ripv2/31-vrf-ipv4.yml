message: |
  The device under test has two VRFs with two interfaces in each VRF.
  Routers are attached to those interfaces and run RIP and BGP with
  device under test.

  This scenario tests RIPv2 in VRF, redistribution of connected subnets
  into RIPv2 and two-way RIPv2-to-BGP redistribution.

  * r1 and r2 should be able to ping each other
  * r3 and r4 should be able to ping each other
  * r1 should not be able to reach r3
