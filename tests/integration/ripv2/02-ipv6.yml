  This lab tests the basic RIPng deployment. The device under test has two
  RIPng interfaces and has to exchange RIPng routes over both of them.

defaults.sources.extra: [ ipv6-defaults.yml ]

module: [ ripv2 ]

  probes:
    device: frr
    provider: clab
    members: [ x1, x2 ]

- x1:                     # FRR does not advertise loopback prefixes over RIPNG, so we have to add
- x2:                     # ... bogus stub links to have advertisable prefixes
