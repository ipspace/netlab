  The devices under test are an EVPN leaf and an EVPN spine device using EVPN
  over unnumbered EBGP session. The EVPN leaf device should originate the EVPN
  routes, and the EVPN spine device should propagate EVPN AF routes between
  PE-devices, resulting in VXLAN-based VLAN extension.

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase
