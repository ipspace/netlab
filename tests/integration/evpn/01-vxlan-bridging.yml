  The device under test is an EVPN PE-device bridging two VLANs over VXLAN. The
  other EVPN PE-device is an FRR container.

  Both VLANs are using the same IP prefix to identify potential inter-VLAN
  leaking.

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3 or h4

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to STP learning
  phase
