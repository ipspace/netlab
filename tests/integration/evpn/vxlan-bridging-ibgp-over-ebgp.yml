  This test case builds a leaf-and-spine fabric with VLAN-over-VXLAN
  bridging using IBGP-over-EBGP design.

  The leaf switches are doing VLAN/VXLAN encap/decap, the
  spine switches are pure IP routers running BGP and EVPN.

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase

  To change the devices under test, use netlab up -d parameter
