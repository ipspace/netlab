  The device under test is a VLAN-to-VXLAN layer-3 switch between two access
  VLANs and two VXLAN VNIs. Both EVPN PE-devices perform inter-VLAN routing
  using transit VNI (symmetrical IRB) when needed.

  All hosts should be able to ping each other.

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to STP learning
  phase.
