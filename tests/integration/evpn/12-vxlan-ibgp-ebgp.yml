  The devices under test are an EVPN PE-device and an EVPN route reflector. The
  PE-device should originate EVPN routes with correct next-hop and the RR should
  propagate EVPN AF routes between PE-devices, resulting in VXLAN-based VLAN
  extension. However, the core routing protocol is not OSPF but EBGP faked with
  BGP local-as settings. The overall design is thus EVPN IBGP between loopbacks
  running over IPv4 EBGP.

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase
