  The device under test is an EVPN spine device using EVPN-over-EBGP. It should
  propagate EVPN AF routes between PE-devices, resulting in VXLAN-based VLAN
  extension.

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase
