  This test case builds a leaf-and-spine fabric with VLAN-over-VXLAN
  bridging. The leaf switches are doing VLAN/VXLAN encap/decap, the
  spine switches are IP routers running OSPF, BGP, and EVPN.

  Assuming the 'vxlan-bridging' test case succeeded, this test case
  validates that the EVPN route reflectors, MTU settings and ECMP work as expected.

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other using 1500 bytes IP payload, e.g.
    docker exec -it clab-evpn-h2 ping 172.16.0.1 -s 1472
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase

  To change the devices under test, use netlab up -d parameter
