  The device under test is a VLAN-to-VXLAN layer-3 switch between two access
  VLANs and two VXLAN VNIs. Both PE-devices perform inter-VLAN routing,
  resulting in asymmetrical IRB.

  All hosts should be able to ping each other and all switch loopback IPs

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to STP learning
  phase.
