  The devices under test are layer-3 switches running VXLAN/EVPN with
  symmetric IRB. Hosts are in three VLANs, all in one VRF - red/blue with anycast gateway

  All hosts should be able to ping each other.

addressing:
  anycast-pool:
    ipv4: 10.10.0.0/20
    prefix: 24
    anycast_gateway: 10  # .10 of every ipv4/ipv6 subnet

  anycast-pool2:
    ipv4: 10.20.0.0/20
    prefix: 24
    anycast_gateway: True  # Default: last of every ipv4/ipv6 subnet
