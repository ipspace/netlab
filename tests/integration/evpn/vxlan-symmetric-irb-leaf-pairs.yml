  The devices under test are pairs of layer-3 switches running VXLAN/EVPN with
  symmetric IRB. 4 hosts are in two VLANs, all in one VRF.

  All hosts should be able to ping each other, eventually (may take some time to learn and exchange all routes)

  hosts:
    members: [ h1, h2, h3, h4 ]
    device: linux
  switches:
    members: [ leaf1a,leaf1b,leaf2a,leaf2b,spine ]
    module: [ vlan,vxlan,ospf,bgp,evpn,vrf ]
