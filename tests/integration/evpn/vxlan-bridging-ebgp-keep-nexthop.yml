  The devices under test are VLAN-to-VXLAN leaves using eBGP(v4) with EVPN via a pair of spines

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3

  The next hop on EVPN routes from leaf1 should not be changed by the eBGP spines
