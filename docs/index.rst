ipSpace.net Network Simulation Tools
====================================================

The `ipSpace.net network simulation tools <https://github.com/ipspace/netsim-tools>`_ will help you be more proficient once you decide to drop GUI-based network simulators and to build your labs using CLI and infrastructure-as-code principles.

An overview of tools:

**create-topology**
  Creates a full-blown network topology, Vagrantfile and Ansible inventory from a simple list of nodes and links. :doc:`More details <create-topology>`

**initial-config.ansible**
  Configures common device parameters using topology data generated by **create-topology** and default device configuration templates. Configured parameters include hostname, LLDP, interface admin state, MAC and IP addresses, and optional routing protocols.
  :doc:`More details <configs>`

**create-config.ansible**
  Ansible playbook that creates devices configuration snippets (including configuration module snippets) without deploying them
  on network devices.

**collect-configs.ansible**
  Using Ansible fact gathering or other device-specific Ansible modules, collects device configurations and saves them in
  specified directory (default: **config**).

**config.ansible**
  Applies any set of custom Jinja2 configuration templates to network devices. Includes support for platform-specific configuration templates.

**display-neighbors.ansible**
  Using Ansible fact gathering collect device neighbor data (usually LLDP neighbors) and displays them. Use YAML Ansible output callback for maximum readability.

**connect.sh**
  Use Ansible invetory to SSH to a network using inventory name. Device IP address (**ansible_host**) and username/passwords are retrived from from Ansible inventory. Ideal when you use centralized Vagrant environments and want to connect to the devices while being in playbook development directory.

Libvirt-specific tools
----------------------

**enable-lldp.sh**
  Given libvirt network name, change group_fwd_mask for the corresponding Linux bridge to enable LLDP passthrough across the Linux bridge.
