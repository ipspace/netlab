# Links between Network Devices

Links between virtual lab devices are specified in **links** element of the topology file -- a list of links in one of these formats:

* A dictionary of node names and other link attributes
* A list of node names
* A string in format *a-b*

You can use all three link formats in the same topology file -- they are always converted into a dictionary format first, and then augmented with addressing details.

### Examples

The following link definition contains all variants of specifying nodes connected to a link:

```
---
defaults:
  device: iosv
  
nodes:
- r1
- r2
- r3

links:
- r1-r2
- [ r1, r3 ]
- r2:
  r3:
```

**Note:** You have to use the dictionary format of link definition when you want to specify additional link parameters.

## Link Attributes

A dictionary describing an individual link contains *node names* as well as *additional link attributes*. These link attributes are predefined and used by **create-topology** core:

* **prefix** - [prefix (or a set of prefixes)](#custom-link-addressing) used on the link
* **type** - [link type](#link-types) (lan, p2p, stub)
* **bridge** - [name of the underlying OS network (bridge)](#bridge-names) if supported by the virtualization environment
* **linkindex** [R/O] - link sequence number (starting with one), used to generate internal network names in VirtualBox and default bridge names in libvirt.

Links could contain additional attributes like *bandwidth*. These attributes have to be defined in **defaults.link_attr** list to differentiate them from misspelled node names.

### Example

The *[IGP metric used in BGP route selection](https://github.com/ipspace/netsim-examples/tree/master/BGP/IGP-metric)* scenario uses the following topology file to define link bandwidth on a backup link:

```
defaults:
  device: iosv
  link_attr: [ bandwidth ]

nodes:
- name: e1
  igp: [ isis,ospf ]
  edge: true
- name: e2
  igp: [ isis ]
  edge: true
- name: pe1
  device: nxos
  igp: [ isis,ospf ]

links:
- pe1:
  e1:
- pe1:
  e2:
  bandwidth: 100000
```

## Link Types

Lab topology could contain *stub*, *p2p* and *lan* links. The link type could be specified with the **type** attribute; when that attribute is missing the link type is selected based on the number of devices connected to the link:

* Single node connected to a link ⇒ *stub*
* Two nodes connected to a link ⇒ *p2p*
* More than two nodes connected to a link ⇒ *lan*

The link type influences the [address prefix pool](addressing.md) used to assign IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes to the link and the node addressing:

* Prefixes assigned to point-to-point links are taken from *p2p* pool. The node with the smaller node name gets the lower (.1) address, the other node gets the higher (.2) address. The default addressing setup uses /30 IPv4 prefixes and /64 IPv6 prefixes.
* Prefixes assigned to multi-access (LAN) links are taken from *lan* pool. The host portion of the IP address is the [node ID](nodes.md#augmenting-node-data)
* Stub links are treated exactly like LAN links in release 0.2.

## Custom Link Addressing

You can use the **prefix** attribute to specify IPv4 and/or IPv6 prefix to be used on the link. When the **prefix** attribute is not specified, the link prefix is taken from the corresponding address pool (see above).

The **prefix** attribute could be either an IPv4 CIDR prefix or a dictionary with **ipv4** and/or **ipv6** elements.

You can use the shorthand (string) syntax if you're building an IPv4-only network, for example:

```
- e2:
  pe1:
  type: lan
  prefix: 192.168.22.0/24
```

In dual-stack or IPv6-only environments you have to use the prefix dictionary syntax:

```
- e1:
  pe1:
  prefix:
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::/64
- e1:
  e2:
  prefix:
    ipv4: 192.168.23.0/24
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:2::/64
```

## Bridge Names

Point-to-point links between network devices are implemented with P2P tunnels (assuming the virtualization environment supports them).

Multi-access and stub links are implemented with custom networks (as supported by the underlying virtualization environment). The **bridge** attribute allows you to specify the custom network name; its default value is *name_N* where:

* *name* is the [topology name](create-topology.md#topology-format) or current directory name;
* *N* is the link ID (position of link object in **links** list) starting with 1.

## Augmenting Link Data

Link data and corresponding node data are heavily augmented by the **create-topology** code. The additional link attributes generated by **create-topology** include:

* Global link ID
* Link IPv4 and/or IPv6 prefix
* IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses of attached nodes
* **left** and **right** node on a P2P link

### Examples

Point-to-point link data from topology file:

```
- e1-e2
```

Final link data:

```
- e1:
    ipv4: 10.1.0.1/30
  e2:
    ipv4: 10.1.0.2/30
  linkindex: 1
  left:
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
    ipv4: 10.1.0.1/30
    node: e1
  prefix:
    ipv4: 10.1.0.0/30
  right:
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
    ipv4: 10.1.0.2/30
    node: e2
  type: p2p
```

IPv6-only point-to-point link:

```
- e1:
  pe1:
  prefix:
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::/64
```

Final link data:

```
- e1:
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::1/64
  linkindex: 2
  left:
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/2
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::1/64
    node: e1
  pe1:
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::2/64
  prefix:
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::/64
  right:
    ifname: GigabitEthernet2
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::2/64
    node: pe1
  type: p2p
```

LAN link with two nodes attached to it:

```
- e2: 
  pe1: 
  type: lan
```

Final link data:

```
- bridge: tests_3
  e2:
    ipv4: 172.16.0.2/24
  linkindex: 3
  pe1:
    ipv4: 172.16.0.3/24
  prefix:
    ipv4: 172.16.0.0/24
  type: lan
```

## Augmenting Node Data

Link processing code adds link (interface) data to all nodes connected to links. The link data is created as **links** dictionary within the node data and includes:

* Interface index
* Interface name (derived from device data)
* IPv4 and/or IPv6 addressing
* Neighbor information (node name, remote interface name, remote IPv4/IPv6 address)
* Remote node ID and interface ID for point-to-point links

### Examples

E1 is connected to two point-to-point links:

```
- e1-e2
- e1:
  pe1:
  prefix:
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::/64
```

The **links** dictionary in E1 node data describes E1 interfaces (other node attributes are explained in [network nodes](nodes.md) document):

```
- device: iosv
  id: 1
  links:
  - ifindex: 1
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
    ipv4: 10.1.0.1/30
    linkindex: 1
    neighbors:
      e2:
        ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
        ipv4: 10.1.0.2/30
    remote_id: 2
    remote_ifindex: 1
    type: p2p
  - ifindex: 2
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/2
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::1/64
    linkindex: 2
    neighbors:
      pe1:
        ifname: GigabitEthernet2
        ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:1::2/64
    remote_id: 3
    remote_ifindex: 2
    type: p2p
  loopback:
    ipv4: 10.0.0.1/32
  mgmt:
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/0
    ipv4: 192.168.121.101
    mac: 08-4F-A9-00-00-01
  name: e1
```

E2 is connected to a P2P link and a LAN link:

```
links:
- e1-e2
- e2:
  pe1:
  type: lan
```

E2 node data contains the following interface data:

```
- device: iosv
  id: 2
  links:
  - ifindex: 1
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
    ipv4: 10.1.0.2/30
    linkindex: 1
    neighbors:
      e1:
        ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
        ipv4: 10.1.0.1/30
    remote_id: 1
    remote_ifindex: 1
    type: p2p
  - bridge: tests_3
    ifindex: 2
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/2
    ipv4: 172.16.0.2/24
    linkindex: 3
    neighbors:
      pe1:
        ifname: GigabitEthernet3
        ipv4: 172.16.0.3/24
    type: lan
  loopback:
    ipv4: 10.0.0.2/32
  mgmt:
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/0
    ipv4: 192.168.121.102
    mac: 08-4F-A9-00-00-02
  name: e2
```

## Custom Attributes in Node and Link Data

Custom attributes specified in link data are retained in the link data and copied directly into node interface data.

Example: Bandwidth is specified on a link between E1 and E2:

```
- e1:
  e2:
  prefix:
    ipv4: 192.168.23.0/24
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:2::/64
  bandwidth: 100000
```

Bandwidth parameter is retained in link data:

```
- bandwidth: 100000
  e1:
    ipv4: 192.168.23.1/24
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:2::1/64
  e2:
    ipv4: 192.168.23.2/24
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:2::2/64
  index: 4
  left:
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/3
    ipv4: 192.168.23.1/24
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:2::1/64
    node: e1
  prefix:
    ipv4: 192.168.23.0/24
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:2::/64
  right:
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/3
    ipv4: 192.168.23.2/24
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:2::2/64
    node: e2
  type: p2p
```

The same parameter is also copied in interface data on E1 and E2:

```
- device: iosv
  name: e1
  id: 1
  links:
...
  - bandwidth: 100000
    ifindex: 3
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/3
    ipv4: 192.168.23.1/24
    ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:2::1/64
    neighbors:
      e2:
        ifname: GigabitEthernet0/3
        ipv4: 192.168.23.2/24
        ipv6: 2001:db8:cafe:2::2/64
    remote_id: 2
    remote_ifindex: 3
    type: p2p
...
```
