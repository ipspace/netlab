# Collecting Device Configurations

**netlab collect** command uses Ansible *device facts* modules (or an equivalent list of Ansible tasks) to collect device configurations and store them in specified output directory.

A single configuration file in the output directory is created for most network devices; multiple files are collected from FRR and Cumulus VX.

After collecting the device configurations, you can save them in a tar archive with the `--tar` option and clean up the working directory with `--cleanup` option.

```{tip}
* **netlab collect** command is just a thin wrapper around an Ansible playbook which uses Ansible inventory created by **netlab create** or **netlab up** command.
* When executed with the `-i` option, **â€Œnetlab collect** switches to the lab directory to execute the Ansible playbook, but stores the results within the directory from which it was executed.
```
