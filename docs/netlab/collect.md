# Collecting Device Configurations

The **netlab collect** command collects device configurations using Ansible *device facts* modules (or an equivalent list of Ansible tasks). The configurations are stored in the specified output directory (default: *config*).

A single configuration file in the output directory is created for most network devices; multiple files are collected from FRR and Cumulus VX. The configuration files have a `.cfg` suffix unless you specify a different suffix (without the leading dot) with the `--suffix` parameter.

After collecting the device configurations, you can save them in a tar archive with the `--tar` option and clean up the working directory with the `--cleanup` option.

```{tip}
* The **netlab collect** command is just a thin wrapper around an Ansible playbook which uses the Ansible inventory created by the **netlab create** or **netlab up** command.
* When executed with the `-i` option, **â€Œnetlab collect** switches to the lab directory to execute the Ansible playbook, but stores the results within the directory from which it was executed.
```
