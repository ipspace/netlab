# Optional Configuration Modules

Network topology could refer to additional *configuration modules* that can be used to deploy routing protocols or network services in addition to initial device configuration.

Module-specific parameters can be added to:

* Node or link objects
* Topology
* **defaults** element in the topology, topology defaults, or global defaults.

**Notes:**
* Global module parameters will be merged with node-specific parameters (see *[merging default values](#merging-default-values)* for details).
* Link-level module parameters will be copied into interface data.
* Merging of node-level and interface-level parameters is performed in configuration templates.
* No further processing is performed on module-specific data when expanding network topology.

## Specifying Configuration Modules

* The default configuration modules used in a network topology are specified in **module** top-level element, for example:

```
module: [ ospf ]
```

* The global list of configuration modules is inherited by all nodes in the network topology. You could change per-node list of configuration modules with the node-specific **module** element.

### Example

Given the following topology...

```
module: [ ospf ]
nodes:
- name: c_nxos
  device: nxos
  module: [ ospf, bgp ]
- name: c_csr
  device: csr
- name: j_vsrx
  device: vsrx
  module: []
```

... OSPF and BGP will be configured on **c_nxos**, OSPF will be configured on **c_csr** and no extra configuration will be performed on **j_vsrx**.

## Module-Specific Node and Link Attributes

Module names can be used as elements in **links** and **nodes** structures to set module-specific link- or node attributes. You can also use them to set global parameters (top-level topology elements).

**Notes:**

* The list of [allowed link attributes](links.md#link-attributes) is automatically extended with global module names.
* Global parameters are merged with per-node data. See *[merging default values](#merging-default-values)* for details.

### Examples

All devices should use OSPF area 1: set it globally.

```
module: [ospf]
ospf:
 area: 1

nodes:
- r1
- r2
- r3
```

The default area for **R3** (used on all its interfaces unless specified otherwise) should be backbone area. Set a different OSPF area with a node attribute:

```
module: [ospf]
ospf:
 area: 1

nodes:
- r1
- r2
- r3:
    ospf:
      area: 0
```

The link between R2 and R3 should be in area 0. Set OSPF area with a link attribute. Also set OSPF cost to 3:

```
- r2:
  r3:
  ospf:
    area: 0
    cost: 3
```

## Using Modules when Deploying Device Configurations

During the initial device configuration, the **[netlab initial](../netlab/initial.md)** command generates and deploys configuration snippets for every module specified on individual network devices.

**Notes:**

* The configuration snippets are created from templates in the **netsim/ansible/templates/_module_** directory.
* The device-specific template is selected based on **ansible_network_os** value. For example, `netsim/ansible/templates/ospf/eos.j2` will be used to create OSPF configuration for an Arista EOS device.

For more information, see [list of configuration modules](module-reference.md)

## Merging Default Values

Module parameters are always a dictionary of values stored under the *module-name* key in defaults, topology, node or link. Link module parameters are not changed during the topology expansion, node module parameters are adjusted based on topology parameters and defaults:

* Global and topology defaults are merged with the **defaults** setting in topology file (see [*topology defaults*](defaults.md) and *[merging defaults](addressing.md#merging-defaults)*)
* For every module used in network topology, the default module parameters are merged with topology-level settings.
* For every node, the topology-level settings for modules used by that node are merged with the node-level settings.
* Final node-level settings are saved into expanded topology file or Ansible inventory, and used by configuration templates.

### Example

The module parameter defaults will be illustrated with the following OSPF+BGP topology. The topology uses **defaults** element for simplicity reasons; you could specify the same parameters in topology- or global defaults.

```
defaults:
  device: iosv
  ospf:
    area: 0.0.0.0
    process: 2
  bgp:
    as: 65000

module: [ ospf ]
ospf:
  process: 1

nodes:
  r1:
    ospf:
      id: 17
      area: 0.0.0.1
  r2:
    module: [ bgp,evpn ]
```

Before the merge process starts, the global list of modules is augmented with node-specific modules, resulting in:

```
module: [ ospf,bgp,evpn ]
```

For every module used in network topology, the default values are added to global parameter values, resulting in:

```
ospf:
  area: 0.0.0.0
  process: 1
bgp:
  as: 65000
```

**Notes:**
* OSPF area is taken from defaults;
* OSPF process ID is specified as a global parameter and is not overwritten with a default value;
* Even though there was no global BGP setting, it's copied from the defaults.

Finally, the global settings are merged with node settings, resulting in:

```
nodes:
  r1:
    ospf:
      area: 0.0.0.1
      id: 17
      process: 1
  r2:
    bgp:
      as: 65000
```

**Notes:**
* OSPF area was specified for R1, and is not replaced.
* OSPF process ID was not specified for R1. It's copied from the global OSPF parameters.
* OSPF router ID was specified for R1, but not in global parameters. It's not changed.
* R2 had no BGP parameters. BGP parameters were copied from global BGP parameters.
