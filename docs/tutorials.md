# Getting Started

In this tutorial we'll build a simple 2-node network running OSPF. We're assuming you already [installed *netlab* and all the other software needed to run your labs](install.md)[^NEED_ANS].

```{tip}
If you plan to run your lab on MacOS or Windows, use [Vagrant with VirtualBox](labs/virtualbox.md). If you plan to run your lab on a Linux server or VM, use [containerlab](labs/clab.md).
```

[^NEED_ANS]: Ansible is used to configure network devices and to parse inventory data for **netlab connect** command. You don't need Ansible if you plan to use *netlab* solely to create Vagrantfile.

## Other Options

You might want to start somewhere else:

<!--
* For a step-by-step tutorial starting with *let's create a Linux virtual machine on our Windows/Mac laptop*, please read *[A Quick Introduction to Netsim-Tools](https://blog.kirchne.red/netsim-tools-quickstart.html)* by [Leo Kirchner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-kirchner/).
-->
* [Julio Perez](https://github.com/JulioPDX) wrote a [container-focused tutorial using Arista cEOS](https://juliopdx.com/2022/02/13/network-simulation-tools-and-containerlab/).
* For more complex tutorials, check the *[More Tutorials](#more-tutorials)* section at the end of this document.

Still here? Let's roll...

## Preparing the Network Device Images

We'll use Arista EOS image available for download on [Arista's web site](https://www.arista.com/en/support/software-download) (login required). Alternatively, you could use Cumulus VX, but it's a bit harder to work with unless you're used to working with Linux-based network devices using FRR.

If you're using VirtualBox with Vagrant:

* Download the Arista vEOS Box file. The most recent vEOS version accessible in that format at the time this document was last updated was `vEOS-lab-4.24.8M-virtualbox.box`.
* Install the .box file with `vagrant box add <box-filename> --name arista/veos`

If you're using containerlab, [download and install cEOS image](labs/ceos.md).

## Creating Lab Topology File

In an empty directory create the [lab topology file](topology-overview.md) `topology.yml`. 

```
---
provider: virtualbox
defaults.device: eos
module: [ ospf ]

nodes: [ r1, r2 ]
links: [ r1, r2, r1-r2 ]
```

The networking lab specified in the above topology file:

* Uses *virtualbox* Vagrant provider.
* Uses Arista vEOS as the default device
* Uses OSPF as the routing protocol
* Has two nodes (*r1* and *r2*)
* Has three links -- a stub network connected to *r1*, another stub network connected to *r2*, and a link between *r1* and *r2*.

**Notes:**
* Replace `provider: virtualbox` with `provider: clab` if you're running Arista cEOS container with *containerlab*.
* If you prefer using Cumulus VX, replace `defaults.device: eos` with `defaults.device: cumulus`

## Starting the Lab

The easiest way to start the lab is to execute **[netlab up](netlab/up.md)** command which:

* Creates `Vagrantfile` or `clab.yml`, and Ansible inventory files;
* Starts the devices with **vagrant up** or **containerlab deploy** command
* Configures the devices with **netlab initial** command.

### Creating Configuration Files

**netlab up** executes **netlab create** to create `Vagrantfile`, `hosts.yml` (Ansible inventory file) and `ansible.cfg` (Ansible configuration file), resulting in a printout similar to this one:

```
Created provider configuration file: Vagrantfile
Created group_vars for eos
Created host_vars for r1
Created host_vars for r2
Created minimized Ansible inventory hosts.yml
Created Ansible configuration file: ansible.cfg
```

### Start the Virtual Devices

After the configuration files have been created, **netlab up** creates the virtual networking infrastructure (if needed) and starts the lab with **vagrant up** or **sudo containerlab deploy -t clab.yml**.

You can expect to see a printout similar to the one below if you're using VirtualBox:

```
Bringing machine 'r1' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
Bringing machine 'r2' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> r1: Importing base box 'arista/veos'...
==> r1: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
==> r1: Setting the name of the VM: x_r1_1621787250237_83508
==> r1: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
==> r1: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
    r1: Adapter 1: nat
    r1: Adapter 2: intnet
    r1: Adapter 3: intnet
==> r1: Forwarding ports...
    r1: 22 (guest) => 2001 (host) (adapter 1)
    r1: 80 (guest) => 8001 (host) (adapter 1)
    r1: 830 (guest) => 3001 (host) (adapter 1)
==> r1: Running 'pre-boot' VM customizations...
==> r1: Booting VM...
==> r1: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
    r1: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2001
    r1: SSH username: root
    r1: SSH auth method: private key
    
... rest deleted...
```

### Deploy Device Configurations

Deploying device configurations -- the final step in the **netlab up** process -- requires a working Ansible installation. Please follow the instructions in [Installing Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-specific-operating-systems) documentation[^1], or use **[netlab install ansible](netlab/install.md)** on Ubuntu.

[^1]: I prefer using **homebrew** to install Ansible on MacOS.

The Ansible inventory created by **netlab up** or **netlab create** command contains enough information to configure interfaces and OSPF routing process. Here's the inventory information for *r1* (`host_vars/r1/topology.yml`):

```
# Ansible inventory created from ['lab.yml', 'package:topology-defaults.yml']
#
---
box: arista/veos
links:
- bridge: x_1
  ifindex: 1
  ifname: Ethernet1
  ipv4: 172.16.0.1/24
  linkindex: 1
  neighbors: {}
  type: stub
- ifindex: 2
  ifname: Ethernet2
  ipv4: 10.1.0.1/30
  linkindex: 3
  name: r1 -> r2
  neighbors:
    r2:
      ifname: Ethernet2
      ipv4: 10.1.0.2/30
  remote_id: 2
  remote_ifindex: 2
  type: p2p
loopback:
  ipv4: 10.0.0.1/32
mgmt:
  ifname: Management1
  ipv4: 192.168.121.101
  mac: 08-4F-A9-00-00-01
module:
- ospf
```

To configure the lab devices, **netlab up** runs **[netlab initial](netlab/initial.md)** command.

```{tip}
If you want to inspect the deployed device configurations, execute `netlab initial -v` -- the Ansible playbook will print out the device configurations before they'd be deployed -- or `netlab initial -o` to create configuration snippets in `config` directory.
```

## Connecting to Network Devices

After starting the lab and installing Ansible, you could use the **[netlab connect](netlab/connect.md)** command to connect to network devices[^2] and inspect the OSPF neighbors and IP routing table:

[^2]: **netlab connect** uses Ansible inventory to find the administrator username and password, device IP address and SSH port name.

```
$ netlab connect r1

## Cleanup

Destroy the lab with **[netlab down](netlab/down.md)** or **vagrant destroy -f**:

```
$ vagrant destroy -f

==> r2: Destroying VM and associated drives...
==> r1: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> r1: Destroying VM and associated drives...
