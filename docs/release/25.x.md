Cisco Catalyst 8000v:
* _netlab_ tracks the state of the Catalyst 8000v license applied to the nodes with the **cat8000v.license** node attribute. This parameter is set to **premier** on Catalyst 8000v VMs and left empty on Catalyst 8000v vrnetlab containers.
* The VLAN configuration template has been changed to use the new bridge-domain configuration model (service instances are defined as members of **bridge-domain**) when the **cat8000v.license** node attribute is set to **premier**.
