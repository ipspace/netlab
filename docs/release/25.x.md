## New Device Features

Cisco Catalyst 8000v:

* The default container version has been changed to IOS/XE 17.16.01a (see also: [changing device images](tutorial-release)).
* _netlab_ tracks the state of the Catalyst 8000v license applied to the nodes with the **cat8000v.license** node attribute. The [default value of this parameter](caveats-cat8000v) is **premier**.
* _netlab_ checks the configured Catalyst 8000v license level and refuses to configure MPLS, SR-MPLS, VXLAN, or SRv6 on a Catalyst 8000v node if the **cat8000v.license** parameter is not set to **premier**.
* The VLAN configuration template has been changed to use the new bridge-domain configuration model (service instances are defined as members of **bridge-domain**) when the **cat8000v.license** node attribute is set to **premier**. You might have to rebuild your Catalyst 8000v containers using the latest _vrnetlab_ code for the new template to work, or set the **cat8000v.license** parameter to **none** ([more details](caveats-cat8000v)).
