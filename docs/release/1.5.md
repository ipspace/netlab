## New Functionality

(release-1.5.4)=
### Release 1.5.4

* [Juniper vPTX/vEVO](../platforms.md) support by Stefano Sasso (initial configuration, IPv4+IPv6, OSPFv2/v3, IS-IS, BGP, BFD, VLANs, VRFs, MPLS, SR-MPLS)
* [Juniper vSRX](../platforms.md) can be run as a *vrnetlab*-packaged container (by Stefano Sasso)
* Documentation migrated to [netlab.tools](https://netlab.tools)

(release-1.5.3)=
### Release 1.5.3

* ['unknown' device type](platform-unknown) can be used to deploy devices not yet supported by *netlab*
* [Public *libvirt* networks](libvirt-network-external) can be used to connect labs to outside world
* *netlab* can [use (and preserve) existing libvirt networks](libvirt-network)
* [Maximum node name length](nodes-list-of-strings) is configurable.
* Add MPLS VPN support for SR OS
* Improved virtualization provider installation testing with (hopefully) useful error messages
* Support for containerlab 0.41.0

[Breaking changes](release-1.5.3-breaking):

* containerlab 0.41.0 is the minimum version of containerlab that works with release 1.5.3
* Strict validation of provider- and tool attributes might break some advanced topologies

(release-1.5.2)=
### Release 1.5.2

* [External network management tools](../extools.md)
* [Aruba AOS-CX Support](../platforms.md)
* [Reusable topology components](../components.md)
* [Tunnel interfaces](links-tunnel)
* Add `--force` flag to **[netlab down](../netlab/down.md)** command
* Use [Ansible filters in netlab templating system](../labs/clab.md#jinja2-filters-available-in-custom-configuration-files)
* Deploy [per-node custom configuration templates](../dev/config/deploy.md#finding-custom-configuration-templates)
* Dry run mode for **netlab up** and **netlab down** commands.

(release-1.5.1)=
### Release 1.5.1

* [Simplified definition of VLAN access links](module-vlan-creating-access-links)
* [Simplified definition of VRF links](module-vrf-links)
* [Link groups](link-groups)
* [Output module](../outputs/d2.md) for [D2 diagram scripting language](https://d2lang.com/tour/intro)
* Stricter type checks for node names, group names, VLAN names, VRF names, link roles, address pools, device names, and Linux bridges. Names must be *identifiers*: alphanumeric strings up to 16 characters long.
* _netlab_ status file [tracks active lab instances](../netlab/status.md)
* **[netlab create](../netlab/create.md)** command refuses to create provider configuration files in a directory with a running lab instance.
* **[netlab up](../netlab/up.md)** command checks the status file to prevent multiple copies of the same lab instance.

[Breaking changes](release-1.5.1-breaking):

* Identifiers (names) in existing lab topologies might be too long to meet the *identifier* requirements. You will have to shorten those names.
* [Default ASAv password was changed](release-1.5.1-breaking-asav). You might have to rebuild your ASAv boxes.

(release-1.5.0)=
### Release 1.5.0

* [Multi-provider topologies](../labs/multi-provider.md)
* [Running multiple lab instances on Linux Servers](../plugins/multilab.md)
* Split large *libvirt* topology into [smaller **vagrant up** batches](../labs/libvirt.md#starting-virtual-machines-in-batches)
* [Use custom network/bridge name and IP subnet](../labs/libvirt.md#libvirt-management-network) for `vagrant-libvirt` management network
* Create DHCP bindings for the whole `vagrant-libvirt` management subnet
* ['loopback' link type](../links.md#loopback-links) can be used to create additional loopback interfaces
* **[netlab show devices](../netlab/show.md)** command displays valid device types
* Split `topology-defaults.yml` into numerous smaller files
* Strict validation of core and module attributes

## Breaking changes

(release-1.5.3-breaking)=
### Release 1.5.3

* Containerlab [changed topology attribute names](https://containerlab.dev/rn/0.41/) in release 0.41.0, forcing us to change topology file template and completely breaking backward compatibility.
* Release 1.5.3 implements strict validation of provider- and tool attributes, which might trigger errors in some topologies. Please open an issue if we missed a provider attribute you need.

(release-1.5.2-breaking)=
### Release 1.5.2

* We switched to Python Box 7.0.x and replaced tons of calls to `get_from_box` (internal function to get a value from a hierarchical key) with calls to Box `.get` method. That migration might have broken some obscure code path that is not covered with our CI/CD tests.
* Loopback interface names for loopback links and VRF loopbacks are sequential within a single node, starting with one. Previously, loopback interfaces created from links used `linkindex` (a low value based on links list), and VRF loopbacks used `vrfidx` (a value starting with 100).

(release-1.5.1-breaking)=
### Release 1.5.1

#### Maximum Name Length

Release 1.5.1 added stricter checks of node names, group names, VLAN names, VRF names, link roles, addressing pools, devices, and Linux bridges. These names must be *identifiers*: alphanumeric strings (plus hyphen and underscore) up to 16 characters long. You might have to shorten too-verbose names in your topology files.

(release-1.5.1-breaking-asav)=
#### ASAv Default Password

Newer ASAv versions enforce a minimum password length of 8. The default password (*vagrant*) was changed to *vagrant1*. You should rebuild your ASAv Vagrant boxes to use the new password (using the new build recipe), or change the defaults through *user default file* containing:

```
devices.asav.group_vars.ansible_ssh_pass: vagrant
devices.asav.group_vars.ansible_become_password: vagrant
```

(release-1.5.0-breaking)=
### Release 1.5.0

Release 1.5.0 introduced strict validation of topology attributes. We ran extensive tests, including all the integration tests, so we're pretty sure that whatever we ever wanted to use still works. Obviously it's possible you used a combination of attributes that we did not test, or that we did not check attribute types in the past and unexpected types just worked.

We had to change the underlying data structure from lists of attributes to hierarchical dictionaries, we expect most plugins that added new core- or module attributes to break. Please take a look at the updated plugins in `netsim/extra` directory to see how your plugin should add new attributes (or open a GitHub case and we'll help you).
