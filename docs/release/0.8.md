# Changes in Release 0.8 and 0.8.1

## Unified CLI

* Various scripts and Ansible playbooks are now available under a single [**netlab** command](../netlab/cli.md)
* [Legacy commands](../legacy-cli/legacy.md) are still available when forking the GitHub repository. You can also emulate them using bash aliases created with **netlab alias** command.

## New Platform Support (release 0.8.1)

* Cumulus VX containers or micro-VMs are supported under *containerlab* provider
* Baseline Nokia SR Linux support under *containerlab* provider

## Installation as a Python Package

* *netsim-tools* are available on PyPI. Installing the package also creates the **netlab** command.

## Virtual Lab Installation and Testing

* **[netlab install](../netlab/install.md)** command can used to install Ubuntu components, Ansible, or Vagrant+libvirt.
* **[netlab test](../netlab/test.md)** command sets up a fully-functional virtual test lab under VirtualBox or libvirt. Release 0.8.1 adds support for containerlab testing.

## Extending YAML Syntax with Dotted Keys (release 0.8.1)

You can use hierarchical names in YAML files instead of a hierarchy of dictionaries. For example, you could replace...

```
addressing:
  loopback:
    ipv6: 2001:db8::/48
```

... with

```
addressing.loopback.ipv6: 2001:db8::/48
```

## Changing Topology with CLI Parameters (release 0.8.1)

The new `-s` CLI parameter can be used to set individual topology parameters within the **netlab create** command. See **[netlab create](../netlab/create.md)** documentation for more details.

## Reorganizing Source Tree

Ansible-related source code (playbooks, tasks, templates) has been moved into `netsim/ansible` directory to include it into the _netsim-tools_ package.
