## New Developer Resources in Release 1.2.4

* [VRF developer guide](../dev/config/vrf.md)

## Bug Fixes in Release 1.2.4

* Fix VLAN support in platform overview document
* Use topology groups as graph clusters
* Fix the merge of interface- and VLAN subinterface data
* Implement complete vlan.mode inheritance
* Remove 'vlan_name' attribute from links and interfaces
* Update routed VLAN subinterface name in neighbor lists
* Link-level attributes are propagated to attached nodes based on configuration modules used by those nodes
* Propagate global VLAN attributes to VLAN access links
* Doc fix: updated description of vlan.trunk dictionary
* Set VLAN mode on routed virtual links, not on parent interfaces
* Copy VLAN data into routed subinterfaces
* Use parent interface and subinterface data to create subinterface name (needed to get VLAN ID into subinterface name)

## Bug Fixes in Release 1.2.3

* Don't create bogus VLAN data for single-node VLANs
* Don't copy provider-specific attributes into VLAN interfaces
* Disable Ansible deprecation warnings
* Don't use **sudo** for Ansible installed in Python virtual environment
