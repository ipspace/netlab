# Changes in Release 1.4

## New Functionality in Release 1.4

* MPLS/LDP support on Nokia SR OS
* EVPN MPLS transport on Arista EOS and Nokia SR Linux
* New address allocation algorithm for links with small IPv4 prefixes
* Control allocation of VNI identifiers with **vxlan.vlans** attribute
* Specify EVPN-enabled VLANs and VRFs with **evpn.vlans** and **evpn.vrfs** lists

## Breaking changes

Release 1.4 introduced behind-the-scenes functionality that might break existing topologies:

* **vni** attribute is assigned to VLANs only if the topology uses VXLAN module. In release 1.3, the **vni** attribute was assigned by the VLAN module.
* **vlan.auto_vni** attribute is no longer used. Specify VXLAN-enabled VLANs with **vxlan.vlans** if you don't want to assign **vni** values to all VLANs.
* EVPN module using VXLAN transport still takes control of all VLANs with **vni** attribute and VRFs with **evpn** attribute, but it's not recommended to rely on that behavior. Specify EVPN-enabled VLANs and VRFs with **evpn.vlans** and **evpn.vrfs** lists.
* Flexible address allocation algorithm might change IP addresses on links with small IPv4 prefixes.
* Node, VLAN, and VRF attributes are checked -- topologies that used extra node attributes not related to configuration modules would no longer work. Use **extra_attribute.nodes** to define your own node attributes
* Interface (node-to-link attachment) attributes are checked -- topologies using extra interface attributes not related to configuration modules would no longer work. Use **extra_attribute.interfaces** to define your own interface attributes.
* The tests for unique VNI values are stricter and might break topologies that used duplicate VNI values in VLANs or VRFs.
* Stricter checking of VLANs on VLAN trunks breaks nonsense topologies that had a non-VLAN node connected to a trunk with no native VLAN, or that had a single node using a particular VLAN on the trunk.
