# Changes in Release 1.0.x

## New Devices

* [Jeroen van Bemmel](https://github.com/jbemmel) contributed support for Nokia SR Linux and SR OS (including initial device configuration, OSPF, ISIS, BGP, and SR-MPLS).
* [Stefano Sasso](https://github.com/ssasso) contributed support for Mikrotik RouterOS and VyOS devices. Both device types support IPv4, IPv6, OSPF and BGP. [More details...](../platforms.md)
* [Pete Crocker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petercrocker/) contributed support for Fortinet devices. You can configure IPv4, IPv6 and OSPF. [More details...](../platforms.md) and [caveats](caveats.md#fortinet-fortios).
* Added Vagrant box names for IOSv, CSR and vSRX on VirtualBox. You still have to build the boxes, but at least you won't have to change the default settings.

## New Functionality in Release 1.0.6

* [Plugin packages](../plugins.md) and module extensions.
* [Hierarchical device groups](../groups.md#hierarchical-groups)
* Device-specific module attributes ([more details](../dev/module-attributes.md))
* [Custom deployment templates](../groups.md#custom-configuration-templates) are deployed as part of [initial device configuration](../netlab/initial.md).
* **[netlab initial](../netlab/initial.md)** command includes `--fast` option which uses **free** strategy in Ansible playbooks for faster configuration deployment.
* Multi-access (LAN) links in *containerlab*

## New Functionality in Release 1.0.5

* Vagrant *libvirt* plugin release 0.7.0 destroys *vagrant-libvirt* virtual network during **vagrant destroy** process. **netlab up** now creates the virtual network if needed (by [Stefano Sasso](https://github.com/ssasso))
* XML definition of *vagrant-libvirt* virtual network has been changed to support up to 20 lab devices (by [Pete Crocker](https://github.com/petercrocker))
* Cumulus VX and generic Linux memory requirements have been increased to 1GB (by [Pete Crocker](https://github.com/petercrocker))
* Pre- and post-start lab hooks (needed to support *vagrant-libvirt* provider) (by [Stefano Sasso](https://github.com/ssasso))
* [Custom configuration deployment templates](../groups.md#custom-configuration-templates) can be applied to individual nodes
* A unified framework for [extending lab topology attributes](../extend-attributes.md).

### New documentation

* [Expanded contributor guidelines](../dev/guidelines.md)
* Document [lab topology transformation](../dev/transform.md) steps

## New Functionality in Release 1.0.4

* Links without IP addressing ([set **prefix** to *false*](links.md#link-attributes)) -- contributed by [Stefano Sasso](https://github.com/ssasso)

## New Functionality in Release 1.0.3

* Skip devices that cannot be configured (SR Linux and Fortinet as of release 1.0.3) during **[netlab initial](../netlab/initial.md)** or **[netlab up](../netlab/up.md)** configuration process.
* Execute [configuration-specific task list](../dev/devices.md#configuring-the-device) to configure devices that cannot use template-based configuration.

## New Functionality in Release 1.0.2

* You can [set node attributes on all members in a custom group](../groups.md#setting-node-data-in-groups) with the **node_data** group attribute.
* [BGP module](../module/bgp.md) creates [custom groups based on node AS numbers](../groups.md#automatic-bgp-groups).
* Experimental release of [custom plugins](../plugins.md). I don't expect the plugin structure to change (much), but there is no well-defined API to set data structures in the rest of the *netlab* code (yet).

## New Functionality in Release 1.0.1

* [Custom groups](../groups.md) can be specified in topology file to create custom inventory groups or set inventory group variables.
* Custom groups can specify custom configuration templates that are deployed during the **[netlab up](../netlab/up.md)** process.
* **quiet** CLI flag sets Ansible STDOUT callback to **dense** to minimize the clutter generated by Ansible playbooks invoked by **netlab initial**, **netlab config** or **netlab up** commands.
* **debug** flag of **netlab up** and **netlab down** commands can be used to display commands that would be executed without executing them.

## New Functionality in Release 1.0

* **[netlab up](../netlab/up.md)** enables LLDP passthrough on Linux bridges created with *libvirt* Vagrant plugin.

## Bug Fixes

### Release 1.0.6

* Reorder module list in node data based on module dependencies (#86)
* Check module node attributes in group **node_data** dictionary (#76)

### Release 1.0.5

* Topology-level module attributes can be set even when a module is used by a single node.
* Use 'netlab up' and 'netlab down' in 'netlab test' command
* Fixed Cumulus OSPF and BGP templates (contributed by [Pete Crocker](https://github.com/petercrocker))
* Fixed XML definition for *vagrant-libvirt* (contributed by [Pete Crocker](https://github.com/petercrocker))
* Set node data with '-s' CLI parameter (reported by [Jeroen van Bemmel](https://github.com/jbemmel))
* Improved 'failed to run subprocess' error messages (contributed by [Jeroen van Bemmel](https://github.com/jbemmel))
* Verbosity level (-v flag) is an integer, not a boolean flag. Verbosity level is passed to Ansible playbooks (reported by [Jeroen van Bemmel](https://github.com/jbemmel))
* Don't use Python warnings for error messages

### Release 1.0.4

* Add *no attribute change on route reflection* configuration to Arista EOS BGP template

### Release 1.0.3

* BGP module crashed in a lab with `stub` links
* Vagrant 2.2 uses QEMU sessions on Fedora, resulting in inability to create virtual networks. Disable QEMU sessions in libvirt Vagrantfile template. (found by Leo Kirchner)
* IOS XE uses **no ip domain lookup** instead of **no ip domain-lookup**. (contributed by [Stefano Sasso](https://github.com/ssasso))

## Cleanup

* Moved platform-specific caveats into a separate document (contributed by [Pete Crocker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petercrocker/))
* Added tutorial links
* Cleaned up lab installation instructions
* Remove obsolete CLI commands and related documentation
* Remove Ubuntu installation Ansible playbook (replaced by **netlab install**)
