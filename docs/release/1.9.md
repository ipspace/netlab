## New Functionality

(release-1.9.0)=
### Release 1.9.0

[](generic-routing) supporting:

* Routing policies (route maps), including **match** and **set** commands
* Prefix filters (prefix lists)
* AS-path filters
* BGP community filters

These features are implemented on Arista EOS, ArubaCX, Cisco IOS/IOS-XE, Cumulus Linux, SR Linux, and Vyos.

Other new features:

* Named prefixes
* Modify **[bgp.policy](plugin-bgp-policy)** plugin to use routing policies from the [](generic-routing).
* Load Linux kernel drivers (VXLAN, MPLS) required by device containers (FRR, VyOS)

**Minor improvements:**

* Support for *containerlab* node parameter startup-delay
* Display markdown reports as ASCII text rendered with rich.markdown
* Add `linux-headers-generic` to devcontainer to allow VyOS to run in GitHub Codespaces

(release-1.9.0-device-features)=
**New device features:**

* Support for vJunos-switch running in a vrnetlab container
* Arista cEOS 4.32.1F has a working MPLS data plane
* SR/MPLS on FRR

(release-1.9.0-device-fixes)=
**Minor fixes in device configuration templates:**

* Activate EBGP unnumbered EVPN AF on Arista EOS
* Configure IS-IS IPv4 router-ID on Arista EOS
* Change default Arista cEOS release to 4.32.1F
* Arista EOS expects a single EVPN import/export RT per line
* Cat8000v does not support SR-MPLS
* Cat8000v is a layer-3 switch
* Missing newline in Cumulus EVPN FRR config
* Change FRR release to 10.0.1
* FRR supports EVPN Asymmetric IRB
* Additional tweaks to make EVPN work over EBGP with NXOS
* vPTX EVPN implementation is broken; turning it off
* Remove MTU change from Junos SR configuration template
* Only certain models of SR Linux support SR-MPLS

**New development tools:**

* Implement 'valid_with' data type validation to limit the attributes that can be used together in a data object
* Implement copy/merge between all attribute namespaces to give modules functionality similar to plugins

**Integration tests:**

* EVPN integration tests, including IRB modes, EBGP unnumbered, IBGP-over-EBGP, EBGP-over-EBGP, L3-only EVPN, and L3VPN with PE-CE routing
* SR-MPLS IPv4 and IPv6 integration tests
* EIGRP integration tests

## Breaking changes

(release-1.9.0-breaking)=
### Release 1.9.0

* OSPF is no longer disabled in VRFs using EVPN symmetric IRB. That might break existing lab topologies using OSPF routers connected to EVPN-backed VLANs configured in IRB mode. If needed, disable OSPF in a VRF with **ospf: False**.
* The [Graphite](tools-graphite) configuration file format has changed to adapt to the changes made to the [netreplica/graphite](https://github.com/netreplica/graphite) tool. If your browser fails to display the lab topology, reload the page or clear the browser cache.

## Bug Fixes

(bug-fixes-1.9.0)=
### Bug Fixes in Release 1.9.0

* ebgp.multihop should use a dummy ifname for the pseudo-tunnel between EBGP endpoints
* Make OSPF-over-VXLAN test more complex to require OSPF to work
* Add Sphinx Dark Mode to dev requirements
* Allow 'netlab connect' to pass a command to a tool
* Improve the validation of 'validate' data structures, add hints and tests
* Add 'links-as-a-dictionary' data structure
* Make 'prefix_str' validator accept named prefixes
* IS-IS needs IPv4 router-id for SR-MPLS to work
* Do not use hostnames in Suzieq inventory (SuzieQ cannot use the host /etc/hosts file)
* Use routing.policy.set device features to set BGP features in bgp.policy plugin
* Need to wait a bit longer for OSPF convergence in VRF Lite test
* Increase EBGP session setup wait timer in bgp.policy integration tests
* Static VLAN VNI was rejected when a VLAN was used in a group
* Use **netlab_show_config** Ansible variable to control the display of device configs during **netlab initial** process

## Documentation Fixes

(doc-fixes-1.9.0)=
### Documentation Fixes in Release 1.9.0

* Update EVPN documentation based on the integration test results
* Add links to addressing example documenting the 'allocation' attribute
* Developers should install additional Python modules to run CI/CD tests
* Minor fixes to SR-MPLS documentation
* Change the example link used to illustrate the **bgp.activate** parameter
* Explain how you can disable IBGP sessions with the **bgp.session** parameter
* Remove extra CSS styling that appeared in the final documentation
* Document FRRouting/VyOS limitations in GitHub Codespaces
