## New Functionality

(release-1.9.0)=
### Release 1.9.0

[](generic-routing) supporting:

* Routing policies (route maps), including **match** and **set** commands
* Prefix filters (prefix lists)
* AS-path filters
* BGP community filters

These features are implemented on Arista EOS, ArubaCX, Cisco IOS/IOS-XE, Cumulus Linux, SR Linux, and Vyos.

Other new features:

* [Default route origination](ospf-default) in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3  on Arista EOS, Aruba CX, Cisco IOS/XE, Cumulus Linux, FRRouting, and Vyos.
* [Route import](routing_import) (redistribution) into OSPFv2, OSPFv3, and BGP. This feature works in the global routing table and VRFs and is available on Arista EOS, Aruba CX, Cisco IOS/XE, Cumulus Linux, FRRouting, and Vyos.
* [Named prefixes](named-prefixes)
* Add [**config** action to validation tests](validate-config)
* [Use SuzieQ in validation tests](validate-suzieq)
* [VRF multihop EBGP sessions](plugin-ebgp-multihop), available on Arista EOS, Aruba CX, Cisco IOS/XE, Cumulus Linux, and FRRouting.
* Modify **[bgp.policy](plugin-bgp-policy)** plugin to use routing policies from the [](generic-routing).
* Load Linux kernel drivers (VXLAN, MPLS) required by device containers (FRR, VyOS)

**Minor improvements:**

* Support for *containerlab* node parameter startup-delay
* Display markdown reports as ASCII text rendered with rich.markdown
* Add `linux-headers-generic` to devcontainer to allow VyOS to run in GitHub Codespaces

(release-1.9.0-device-features)=
**New device features:**

* Support for vJunos-switch running in a vrnetlab container
* Arista cEOS 4.32.1F has a working MPLS data plane

* Routing policies, prefix lists, and community lists on Arista EOS, Aruba CX, Cisco IOS/XE, Cumulus Linux, FRRouting, and Vyos
* VRF-aware OSPFv3 on ArubaCX and VyOS
* OSPF default route origination on Arista EOS, Aruba CX, Cisco IOS/XE, Cumulus Linux, FRRouting, and Vyos
* OSPF and BGP route import on Arista EOS, Aruba CX, Cisco IOS/XE, Cumulus Linux, FRRouting, and Vyos
* VRF multihop EBGP sessions on Arista EOS, Aruba CX, Cisco IOS/XE, Cumulus Linux, and FRRouting. 

(release-1.9.0-device-fixes)=
**Minor fixes in device configuration templates:**

ArubaCX:
* Fix BGP next-hop processing on EBGP EVPN AF
* MPLS data plane works only on physical devices

Arista EOS:
* Activate EVPN AF on unnumbered EBGP sessions
* Configure IS-IS IPv4 router-ID in IPv6-only networks
* Change default Arista cEOS release to 4.32.1F
* Arista EOS expects a single EVPN import/export RT per line

Cat8000v:
* Cat8000v does not support SR-MPLS
* Cat8000v is a layer-3 switch

CSR 1000v:
* Cisco CSR 1000v rejects a VNI lower than 4096

Cumulus Linux:
* Missing newline in Cumulus EVPN FRR config
* Explicit configuration of IPv6 LLA on VM interfaces
* RIPv2/ng has to be configured several times to make it work :(
* Add local device name with '-' (instead of '_') to /etc/hosts
* Bump Cumulus Vagrant box release to the latest 4.4 release

FRR:
* Change FRR release to 10.0.1
* FRR supports EVPN Asymmetric IRB
* MPLS VPNv6 does not work

Nexus OS:
* Additional tweaks to make EVPN work over EBGP with NXOS
* Redistribute internal BGP routes to OSPF in EVPN VRFs
* Apply 'allowas-in' to EVPN address family
* EVPN L3VNI needs 'interface-vlan' feature to work

Junos:
* vPTX EVPN implementation is broken; turning it off
* Remove MTU change from Junos SR configuration template

Sonic:
* Remove redundant 'do write' from Sonic BGP configuration template

SR Linux:
* Only certain models of SR Linux support SR-MPLS

VyOS:
* VyOS: enable SSH service when running in containerlab 
* MPLS VPNv6 does not work on VyOS (because FRR)
* allowas-in has to be configured on EVPN AF
* Do not set next-hop to self on EBGP EVPN sessions

**New development tools:**

* Implement 'valid_with' data type validation to limit the attributes that can be used together in a data object
* Implement copy/merge between all attribute namespaces to give modules functionality similar to plugins

**New integration tests:**

* EVPN integration tests, including IRB modes, EBGP unnumbered, IBGP-over-EBGP, EBGP-over-EBGP, L3-only EVPN, and L3VPN with PE-CE routing
* SR-MPLS IPv4 and IPv6 integration tests
* EIGRP integration tests
* EBGP multihop integration tests
* Integration tests for 'routing' module and new OSPF functionality

## Breaking changes

(release-1.9.0-breaking)=
### Release 1.9.0

* The [Graphite](tools-graphite) configuration file format has changed to adapt to the changes made to the [netreplica/graphite](https://github.com/netreplica/graphite) tool. If your browser fails to display the lab topology, reload the page or clear the browser cache.
* OSPF is no longer disabled in VRFs using EVPN symmetric IRB. That might break existing lab topologies using OSPF routers connected to EVPN-backed VLANs configured in IRB mode. If needed, disable OSPF in a VRF with **ospf: False**.
* The link transformation module sets the link **role** to **stub** on all non-VLAN/non-loopback links with no preset role and a single router to make the behavior in multi-provider topologies identical to the behavior in single-provider topologies. This might impact topologies that define the **stub** addressing pool, as these links will now get their IP prefixes from the **stub** pool.
* Cumulus Linux containers are deprecated. While they will continue to work, we won't do any integration tests on them. Use FRRouting containers.
* We will probably change the Cumulus Linux VM version to 5.9 in the future, assuming we can still use direct ifupdown and FRR configuration.

## Bug Fixes

(bug-fixes-1.9.0)=
### Bug Fixes in Release 1.9.0

* Set source interface name (_source_ifname) on IBGP neighbors to simplify BGP configuration templates
* Refactor common IGP post-transform processing
* Use search paths when validating config name in 'netlab config'
* The **ebgp.multihop** plugin should use a dummy ifname for the pseudo-tunnel between EBGP endpoints
* Make OSPF-over-VXLAN test more complex to require OSPF to work
* Add Sphinx Dark Mode to dev requirements
* Allow 'netlab connect' to pass a command to a tool
* Improve the validation of 'validate' data structures, add hints and tests
* Add 'links-as-a-dictionary' data structure
* Make 'prefix_str' validator accept named prefixes
* IS-IS needs IPv4 router-id for SR-MPLS to work
* Do not use hostnames in Suzieq inventory (SuzieQ cannot use the host /etc/hosts file)
* Use the **routing.policy.set** device features to set BGP features in **bgp.policy** plugin
* Need to wait a bit longer for OSPF convergence in the VRF Lite integration test
* Increase EBGP session setup wait timer in the **bgp.policy** integration tests and numerous other timing tweaks (some devices are ridiculously slow)
* Static VLAN VNI was rejected when a VLAN was used in a group
* Use **netlab_show_config** Ansible variable to control the display of device configs during **netlab initial** process
* Color-code and timestamp integration test summary printouts
* Bug fix: use Linux containers (not VMs) in VXLAN integration tests
* Survive edge cases (hosts without loopbacks, interfaces without names or descriptions) in addressing and wiring reports
* Include reports in the Python package
