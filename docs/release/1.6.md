## New Functionality

(release-1.6.2)=
### Release 1.6.2

* [Support for ArubaOS-CX with containerlab](../platforms.md#supported-virtual-network-devices)
* Display a subset of available reports in **[netlab show reports](netlab-show-reports)** command
* Display warnings in reports relying on **ipaddr** Ansible filter
* Add IPv6 prefixes and neighbors to BGP reports
* Add IPv6 column to text addressing report
* Make some columns optional in BGP reports to reduce the report width
* Implement [inter-VRF route leaking](../module/vrf.md#platform-support) for Cumulus/FRR

(release-1.6.1)=
### Release 1.6.1

* **[netlab report](../netlab/report.md)** can generate Markdown markup (ideal for augmenting documentation written in Markdown)
* BGP AS number and BGP neighbor reports (text, Markdown, HTML)
* [Make user/system default locations configurable](defaults-locations)

Internal changes:

* _netsim_ no longer uses `netsim.common` module. This change [might impact existing plugins](release-1.6.1-breaking).

(release-1.6.0)=
### Release 1.6.0

**New commands:**

* **[netlab report](../netlab/report.md)** generates built-in or user-defined text- or HTML reports based on transformed lab topology.
* **[netlab graph](../netlab/graph.md)** command generates [topology graph descriptions](../outputs/graph.md) in GraphViz or D2 format
* **[netlab inspect](../netlab/inspect.md)** command displays data structures in transformed lab topology
* Improved **[netlab show](../netlab/show.md)** command displays information as a table, raw text, or YAML

**New reports:**

The reports you can create with the **[netlab report](../netlab/report.md)** command include:

* Node, interface and link addressing reports
* Lab wiring summary
* Device management IP addresses, usernames, and passwords

**Explore netlab internals**

The **[netlab show](../netlab/show.md)**  command can display:

* Configuration modules and optional features supported by individual modules
* Configuration modules and features supported by individual devices
* Virtualization providers and their status
* Output modules that can be used with the **[netlab create](../netlab/create.md)** command
* System reports you can use with **[netlab report](../netlab/report.md)** command

**External connectivity**:

* [Connect containers to outside world](clab-network-external) through *macvlan* interfaces (requires *containerlab* release 0.43.0)
* [Host-to-VM port forwarding](libvirt-port-forwarding) in *libvirt* environment
* [Mapping of container management ports to host ports](clab-port-forwarding)

**Other new features**:

* Improved FRR VXLAN data plane configuration
* OSPF strict BFD support (RFC 9355)
* Nokia SR OS OSPF P2MP support
* [Add **mgmt._permanent** option](libvirt-mgmt) to make *vagrant-libvirt* management network persistent (fixes #855)

**Documentation improvements:**

* Document Linux loopback interface usage
* Document assignment of management IP addresses in libvirt and containerlab environments
* Rewrite documentation for *external* provider and multi-provider topologies

**Internal changes:**

* Use device **features** instead of module **supported_on** lists to specify modules supported by individual devices
* Device settings inheritance should make it easier to add similar devices. It has been implemented for most device types, including a new Junos meta-device (the parent for vSRX, vMX and vPTX devices).

[Breaking changes](release-1.6.0-breaking):

* `get_from_box` function has been removed

## Breaking changes

(release-1.6.1-breaking)=
### Release 1.6.1

_netlab_ code stopped using `netsim.common` module. That module should no longer be used, but is still included in the package in case some plugins still use it. We'll remove the module in 1.7/2.0 release. 

(release-1.6.0-breaking)=
### Release 1.6.0

* `get_from_box` function has been removed. The function might be used by early plugins which will break when ran with _netlab_ release 1.6.0. Update your plugins to use Box **get** method which supports hierarchical names since version 7.0 ([more details](release-1.5.2-breaking))

## Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes in Release 1.6.2

* Fix EVPN VLAN attributes (#865)
* Bump clab version to 0.44.3 (#864)
* BGP reports should survive topologies with no BGP in them
* 'netlab show reports' skips include files in reports directory
* Migrate simple VRF integration tests to the new "links-in-vrfs" format

### Bug Fixes in Release 1.6.1

* Python package manifest (MANIFEST.in) did not include `show-usage.txt` (the help file for **[netlab show](../netlab/show.md)** command)
* Collect Cumulus Linux interface configuration with `ifquery`
* `ifquery` has to be executed as root on Cumulus Linux

### Bug Fixes in Release 1.6.0

* Allow 'mgmt' attributes in node data
* Change pinned containerlab version to the one supporting macvlan endpoints
* Create system-wide virsh networks during 'netlab up'
* Fix a typo in a BGP attribute type
* Update SRv6 module to use new dictionary-based attribute definition

## Documentation Fixes

### Documentation Fixes in Release 1.6.2

* Rewrote confusing introduction to BGP configuration module platform feature support
* Fix a 'device image default' example that contained invalid container name

### Documentation Fixes in Release 1.6.1

* Use consistent anchors in "netlab show" documentation
* New Aruba download link
