* **[netlab inspect](../netlab/inspect.md)** command displays data structures in transformed lab topology
* Improved **[netlab show](../netlab/show.md)** command displays information as a table, raw text, or YAML

**New reports:**

The reports you can create with the **[netlab report](../netlab/report.md)** command include:

* Node, interface and link addressing reports
* Lab wiring summary
* Device management IP addresses, usernames, and passwords

**Explore netlab internals**

The **[netlab show](../netlab/show.md)**  command can display:

* Configuration modules and optional features supported by individual modules
* Configuration modules and features supported by individual devices
* Virtualization providers and their status
* Output modules that can be used with the **[netlab create](../netlab/create.md)** command
* System reports you can use with **[netlab report](../netlab/report.md)** command

**External connectivity**:

* [Connect containers to outside world](clab-network-external) through *macvlan* interfaces (requires *containerlab* release 0.43.0)
* [Host-to-VM port forwarding](libvirt-port-forwarding) in *libvirt* environment
* [Mapping of container management ports to host ports](clab-port-forwarding)

**Other new features**:

* Improved FRR VXLAN data plane configuration
* OSPF strict BFD support (RFC 9355)

**Documentation improvements:**

* Document Linux loopback interface usage

* Rewrite documentation for *external* provider and multi-provider topologies

**Internal changes:**

* Use device **features** instead of module **supported_on** lists to specify modules supported by individual devices
