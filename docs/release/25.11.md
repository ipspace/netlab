### Built-in ipaddr/hwaddr Jinja2 Filters

The [drastic changes made in Ansible core release 2.19](https://blog.ipspace.net/2025/09/netlab-25-09-post1/) broke several built-in netlab templates, forcing us to use Ansible 11.x with netlab release 25.09-post1.

_netlab_ used core- and **ipaddr** Ansible filters in its Jinja2 templates, but even the import of these filters triggered the changes in Jinja2 behavior, making a clean split with Ansible *in core netlab code* the only viable option. The device configuration templates are not affected as they're rendered within an Ansible playbook.

_netlab_ release 25.11 implements its own version of **ipaddr** and **hwaddr** filters that provide the small subset of functionality required in built-in Jinja2 templates. This change might break customized provider configuration file templates, custom daemon configuration files, complex validation code using Jinja2 expressions, or custom reports.

Please open an issue if you need an Ansible filter or **ipaddr** behavior that we did not implement.
