## New Functionality

* The **[netlab graph](netlab-graph)** command can generate PNG/SVG/JPEG/PDF graphs if you have D2 or Graphviz installed
* You can generate [reports](netlab-report) and [graphs](netlab-graph), or inspect transformed topology data without starting a lab
* You can use device-based groups (for example, **eos** or **frr** groups) to set node attributes ([breaking change](release-25.11-breaking-groups)). Previously, these groups could be used solely to set Ansible group variables.
* Internal **ipaddr**/**hwaddr** Jinja2 filters (see also [](release-25.11-breaking))

**Minor improvements**

* Make netlab documentation available on [GitHub Pages](https://ipspace.github.io/netlab/)
* When needed, unzip disk images in the **[netlab libvirt package](netlab-libvirt-package)** command
* Calculate missing OSPF interface timers
* Warn about Ansible 12.x installation instead of giving up immediately
* The **[files](plugin-files)** plugin refuses to create files outside of the lab directory
* Use a generic "wait for SSH server" readiness test for all vrnetlab-based containers
* Use a generic "wait for the first physical interface" readiness test for all Junos-based devices
* Add **clab.network-mode** node setting to [disconnect a node from the management network](clab-network-mode) (needed in labs with more than ~1000 devices)
* Generate warnings for EVPN and L3VPN BGP sessions without extended communities

## Breaking changes

### Built-in ipaddr/hwaddr Jinja2 Filters

The [drastic changes made in Ansible core release 2.19](https://blog.ipspace.net/2025/09/netlab-25-09-post1/) broke several built-in netlab templates, forcing us to use Ansible 11.x with netlab release 25.09-post1.

_netlab_ used core- and **ipaddr** Ansible filters in its Jinja2 templates, but even the import of these filters triggered the changes in Jinja2 behavior, making a clean split with Ansible *in core netlab code* the only viable option. The device configuration templates are not affected as they're rendered within an Ansible playbook.

_netlab_ release 25.11 implements its own version of **ipaddr** and **hwaddr** filters, which provide the small subset of functionality required in built-in Jinja2 templates. This change might break customized provider configuration file templates, custom daemon configuration files, complex validation code using Jinja2 expressions, or custom reports.

```{warning}
While the built-in Jinja2 templates are used to generate daemon configuration files, the **‌netlab initial --output** command still uses an Ansible playbook (and Ansible filters) to generate them.

You can find the correct version of the daemon configuration files in the **‌clab_files/_node_** directory.

We plan to fix this behavior in the next _netlab_ release.
```

Please open an issue if you need an Ansible filter or **ipaddr** behavior that we did not implement.

(release-25.11-breaking-groups)=
### Device-Based Groups

Previous _netlab_ releases allowed you to specify members of a device group (for example, **eos** or **frr** group).

Starting with release 25.11, _netlab_ builds the member list of device groups from node **device** attribute, and reports an error if you define a **member** list in such a group.

* Include the whole `tools` directory in the **networklab** package
