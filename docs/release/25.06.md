## New Functionality

(release-25.06)=
* Redistribute static routes into BGP, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, RIPv2, RIPng, and IS-IS
* Blackhole/discard static routes (static routes pointing to *null* interface)

(release-25.06-device-features)=

* Workaround to run vPTX on an AMD CPU

(release-25.06-sros-features)=

* VRF-aware EBGP multihop
* VRF-aware IS-IS and OSPFv3
* Inter-VRF route leaking in MPLS/VPN deployments
* Route import into BGP, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, and IS-IS

VyOS:

(release-25.06-device-fixes)=
## Fixes in Configuration Templates

FortiOS:
* Interface MTU configuration
* Increase required RAM to 2G

FRR:
* Change default version to 10.3.1

Junos:
* Align vSRX containerlab image name with the one used by *vrnetlab*
* Remove MPLS bgp-igp-both-ribs

(release-25.06-sros-bug-fixes)=
Nokia SR OS:
* Fixed EBGP multihop and EBGP-over-EBGP EVPN configurations
* Use SR-MPLS for IPv6 next hops
* Configure standard IPv6 LLA for VRRPv3
* Set the correct port mode for all VLAN combinations
* Import BGP-VPN routes into VRF BGP and OSPF processes
* Survive layer-2-only VRFs
* Configure **next-hop-unchanged** and **inter-as-vpn** in EVPN-over-EBGP scenarios
* Fix layer-2 EVPN configuration
* Implement BGP **allowas-in**
* Fix VRF route redistribution and default routing policies
* Disable BGP neighbors with no active AFs
* Control prefix origination for IBGP neighbors (previously, all routes from the routing table were advertised as IBGP routes)
* Fix BGP route reflection
* Generate IPv6 route advertisements
* Use IES (not VPRN) service for global SVI interfaces 
* Use 'ip-mtu' for MTU lower than 1500
* Sync netlab and SR-OS interface names
* Fix multiple errors in the IS-IS configuration template
* Cleanup the Ansible configuration deployment task list

Nokia SR OS caveats reported as device quirks:

* Inter-VRF route leaking without MPLS/VPN is not implemented
* IPv4 unnumbered does not work with IPv6 GUA
* Adjust system interface IPv6 prefix length to /128
* _netlab_ does not configure an alternate VTEP IP address

## Bug Fixes

(bug-fixes-25.06)=
* Ubuntu Linux VMs (using netplan) cannot create extra loopbacks
* Use standard timeouts in multi-VRF OSPFv3 test
* Redistribution of IPv6 prefix into BGP takes 40 seconds on IOS
* BGP integration tests need loopback interfaces
* Alt-VTEP test is meaningless if traffic starts from the tested device
* Check daemon config files before Ansible config templates
* Add "static" feature flag description for "routing" module
* Enable import (redistribution) of static routes
* Plugin load error message did not display the search path
* Pass CPU model to VM-defining XML template in 'libvirt package'
* Refactor the CPU determination code into get_cpu_model function
* Install nokia.srlinux collection as part of grpc installation
* Install ncclient as part of Ansible installation
* Use -O flag to force SCP to be used when copying configurations to network devices (#2322)
* Pre-commit push event is triggered only on changes in YAML and Python files
* Run CI/CD checks only on changed Python/YAML files
* Resend BGP prefixes from FRR probes after setting allowas-in on tested device
* Use /128 IPv6 loopback in BGP integration tests (#2317)
* SR-OS does not support unnumbered EBGP sessions
* Do not retry SR-OS configuration deployment
* Update MANIFEST.in to include netsim/daemons subdirectories (#2309)
