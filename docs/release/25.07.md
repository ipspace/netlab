## New Functionality

(release-25.07)=
* The [ospf.areas plugin](plugin-ospf-areas) supports OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 stub areas, NSSA areas, and area ranges.
* The [BGP routing policies](plugin-bgp-policy) plugin supports aggregate BGP routes
* The [BGP configuration module](module-bgp) supports BGP confederations
* The [evpn.multihoming](plugin-evpn-multihoming) plugin implements EVPN Ethernet Segment Identifiers and EVPN-based MLAG/multihoming
* Updated [installation process](netlab-install): The user-interfacing part of the installation scripts has been moved to the Python code, resulting in a more consistent user interface. The **[netlab install](netlab-install)** command also checks the Linux distribution you're using and refuses to start Debian/Ubuntu installation scripts on non-Debian-ish distributions.
* Baseline OpenBSD support (box-building procedure and initial configuration)
* [Network Unit Testing System (NUTS)](https://github.com/network-unit-testing-system/nuts) external tool integration (#2433)

**Minor improvements**

* Display device support level and major testing caveats in **[netlab show devices](netlab-show-devices)** printout
* Display major per-image caveats in **[netlab show images](netlab-show-images)** printout
* Add `--provider` argument to **[netlab show images](netlab-show-images)**
* Add 'pool' attribute to VRF loopbacks, giving you finer control over the allocation of VRF loopback addresses.
* Add nodes to device-specific _netlab_ groups, allowing you to specify device-based node attributes.
* Check whether external tools were successfully started (mostly used to detect containers that have no ARM support)
* Add '[remove box](netlab-libvirt-remove)' functionality to **[netlab libvirt](netlab-libvirt)** command
* Sort **[netlab install](netlab-install)** scripts in dependency order (#2469)
* New [report](netlab-report): names of selected nodes (to be used in bash scripts) (#2420)

## Integration Tests

Other changes:
* Add dual-stack VRF to IPv6 VRF integration tests
