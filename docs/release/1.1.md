# Changes in Release 1.1

## Breaking Changes

You can skip this section if you're not using custom configuration templates or plugins.

* **links** list in node data (which is also what you get in Ansible inventory) has been renamed to **interfaces**. You'll have to change most device configuration templates. Apologize for the inconvenience; we had to bite that bullet sooner or later.
* **topology.links** and **topology.nodes** changed. You will have to rewrite any plugins you developed for release 1.0. Fortunately, that's pretty easy to do, and the new data structures are easier to work with.
* **ipv4** and **ipv6** interface attributes could be an IP address or a boolean value (for unnumbered/LLA interfaces), requiring additional checks in device configuration templates. You can ignore this change if you're not using unnumbered interfaces.

## New Functionality in Release 1.1

* Layer-2-only address pools
* Layer-2-only interfaces on numbered or unnumbered links
* Unnumbered interfaces attached to numbered links
* Per-protocol unnumbered links (example: IPv4 prefix + IPv6 LLA)
* Specifying node IP address as N-th IP address on the link
* Multiple attachments of a node to the same link (use cases: inter-VRF back-to-back links or bridging loops)
* BFD configuration module (contributed by [Jeroen van Bemmel](https://github.com/jbemmel))
* BFD support for IS-IS and OSPF
* IS-IS over unnumbered multi-access links
* Device capability checks: unnumbered interfaces, OSPF and IS-IS over unnumbered links
* Linux bridges are used to implement multi-access links in *containerlab* (contributed by [Jeroen van Bemmel](https://github.com/jbemmel))

## Major Code Changes

* Nodes data structure has been changed from a list to a dictionary. The change impacts plugins written for release 1.0.x that traverse **nodes** data structure.
* Link data structure has been changed -- nodes connected to a link (previously dictionary keys) are now collected in **interfaces** list.
* Final node data structure has been changed -- **links** (list of interfaces) have been renamed to **interfaces**
* BFD, OSPF, and IS-IS configuration modules calculate interface state in Python code, significantly simplifying Jinja2 device configuration templates.
* IPAM code refactoring -- unifying address handling on all links and adding new functionality:

	* Layer-2-only pools, links, and interfaces
	* Unnumbered multi-access links. Standard IPv6 feature (LLA), might not work for IPv4 on all platforms (depends on platform implementation quality).
	* Per-address-family unnumbered interfaces
	* Unnumbered interfaces on numbered or layer-2-only links

* Tons of new test cases to stress-test IPAM code and increase code coverage

## Cleanup

* Removed ancient (release 0.1) management network addressing parameters
