# Changes in Release 1.1

## New Functionality in Release 1.1

* Layer-2-only address pools
* Layer-2-only interfaces on numbered or unnumbered links
* Unnumbered interfaces attached to numbered links
* Per-protocol unnumbered links (example: IPv4 prefix + IPv6 LLA)
* Specifying node IP address as N-th IP address on the link
* BFD configuration module (contributed by [Jeroen van Bemmel](https://github.com/jbemmel))
* BFD support for IS-IS and OSPF

## Major Code Changes

* Nodes data structure has been changed from a list to a dictionary. The change impacts plugins written for release 1.0.x that traverse **nodes** data structure.
* IPAM code refactoring -- unifying address handling on all links and adding new functionality:

	* Layer-2-only pools, links, and interfaces
	* Unnumbered multi-access links. Standard IPv6 feature (LLA), might not work for IPv4 on all platforms (depends on platform implementation quality).
	* Per-address-family unnumbered interfaces
	* Unnumbered interfaces on numbered or layer-2-only links

* Tons of new test cases to stress-test IPAM code and increase code coverage

## Cleanup

* Removed ancient (release 0.1) management network addressing parameters
