## New Functionality

(release-2.0.1)=
### Release 2.0.1

Release 2.0.1 includes [bug](bug-fixes-2.0.1) and [documentation](doc-fixes-2.0.1) fixes as well as these minor device configuration improvements:

* Cumulus Linux 5.x: configure OSPF areas in VRFs
* Default SR Linux release is 25.3.2
* IOS XR: support for multiple loopback interfaces

(release-2.0.0)=
### Release 2.0.0

* Well-defined [node roles](node-router-host) (**host**, **router**, **bridge**) available on [multiple platforms](platform-host)
* **[firewall.zonebased](plugin-firewall-zonebased)** plugin
* **bridge** nodes can be used as [simple bridges](node-role-bridge) or to [implement multi-access links](node-bridge-lan)
* **[netlab defaults](netlab-defaults)** command provides **sysctl**-like CLI interface to user/system defaults.
* Gather usage statistics into a local file that can be inspected or managed with **[netlab usage](netlab-usage)**
* SRv6: [BGP L3VPN support](module-srv6)
* Use the **routing** module to configure static routes on [**host** devices](node-role-host). VRF-aware devices can use a default route; other devices get more specific routes for address pools and named prefixes.
* Multiple [EVPN import/export route targets](evpn-vlan-service) allow you to build complex EVPN-based services like *common services* or *hub-and-spoke connectivity*
* Implement [node/link styles for D2 graphs](outputs-d2-link-node-attributes)
* Implement 'delete communities matching a list' in [routing policies](generic-routing-policies)

**Retirements**

* [Cumulus Linux 4.x is retired](caveats-cumulus). While there are no plans to remove it from _netlab_, we will not add new features or run integration tests.
* [VirtualBox and direct Windows/macOS installations](lab-virtualbox) are obsolete.

**Minor improvements**

* Names of **defaults.const.validate** constants [can be used as wait times](validate-retry) in the validation **wait** parameter
* Recognize **all** and device types in the [node selection expressions](netlab-inspect-node) used in **netlab inspect**, **netlab report** and **netlab exec** commands
* Use a different Ansible task list when reloading device configuration
* Accept 'int' and 'bool' values for management IP addresses
* Combine default tcpdump flags with user filter in the **[netlab capture](netlab-capture)** command
* Change the installed Vagrant version to 2.4.3-1
* Check reserved ranges (local network, multicast) during IPv4/IPv6 address/prefix validation
* Warn about EBGP 'bgp' attributes used on intra-AS links/vlans

## Breaking changes

(release-2.0.0-breaking)=
### Release 2.0.0

#### Attribute Inheritance

We implemented a generic mechanism to indicate that an attribute should not be inherited from a parent object (groups → nodes, nodes → interfaces, links → interfaces...). Setting an attribute to *False* will break the inheritance chain and remove the attribute.

The only exceptions are the attributes that can accept a *False* value (bools, IP addresses/prefixes); the inheritance chain is broken due to the presence of attributes with *False* values, but they are not removed.

The change did not impact any of our transformation and integration tests, so it should be pretty safe. However, it is not impossible that you'll discover an edge case that works differently than it did in the past.

#### Junos Routing Policy Names

We completely rewrote the Junos routing policies, made them more structured, and started using a chain of routing policies with BGP neighbors.

The names of the routing policies changed as part of that process and might break custom templates that are modifying the set of Junos routing policies for a BGP neighbor.

The list of Junos routing policies _netlab_ applies to a BGP neighbor is available in the **bgp.neighbors[N]._junos_policy** dictionary.
