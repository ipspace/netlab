# VLANs

The VLAN configuration module implements VLANs and VLAN-related interfaces. The current initial implementation supports:

* Access VLANs
* VLAN trunks, including configurable native VLAN
* VLAN interfaces (integrated routing and bridging)
* Bridging-only and IRB VLANs
* Routed subinterfaces

```{warning}
This module is **experimental** for a reason. The VLAN transformation code is the biggest bowl of spaghetti code in the whole system, and is probably full of bugs. We'll whack them as we create more interesting scenarios, but it will take us a while to get there. See also _[](module-vlan-caveats)_.

## VLAN Connectivity Model

The VLAN configuration module assumes you're creating a sane design in which:

* VLAN numbers are globally unique (you're not reusing 802.1q values)
* Every VLAN is contiguous and might span multiple physical links (please note that VLANs bridged across VXLAN or MPLS are still contiguous)
* Every VLAN uses a unique IP subnet across all physical links where it's used.
* On access links, all VLAN-capable devices connected to a link use the same access VLAN.
* On trunk links, all VLAN-capable devices using native VLAN use the same native VLAN.

It might be possible to build topologies that deviate from these rules, but don't be surprised when the results look weird.

## Module Parameters

VLANs are defined in the global or per-node **vlans** dictionary. Global- and node VLAN parameters are merged to get VLAN data for individual nodes.

The following global parameters are used to set VLAN IDs and VNIs in VLAN definitions:

* **vlan.start_vlan_id**: This global value specifies the first auto-assigned VLAN ID (default: 1000).
* **vlan.start_vni**: This global value specifies the first auto-assigned VNI (default: 100000).

## VLAN Definition

VLANs are defined in a global- or node-specific **vlans** dictionary, allowing you to create network-wide VLANs or local VLANs.

```{warning}
Use unique VLAN names when defining node-specific VLANs. There's a subtle interaction between global- and node-specific VLAN definitions.
```

The keys of the **vlans** dictionary are VLAN names, the values are VLAN definitions. A VLAN definition could be empty or a dictionary with one or more of these attributes:

* **id** -- 802.1q VLAN tag
* **vni** -- VXLAN VNI
* **vrf** -- the VRF VLAN belongs to
* **mode** -- default VLAN forwarding mode: **route**, **bridge** or **irb**.
* **prefix** -- IP prefix assigned to the VLAN. The value of the prefix could be an IPv4 prefix or a dictionary with **ipv4** and **ipv6** keys.
* **pool** -- addressing pool used to assign IPv4/IPv6 prefixes to the VLAN. VLAN prefixes are allocated from addressing pools before interface address assignments.
* A VLAN definition can also contain other valid interface-level parameters (for example, VRF name or OSPF cost).

VLAN definitions lacking **id** or **vni** attribute get [default VLAN ID and VNI values](default-vlan-values) assigned during the topology transformation process.

(default-vlan-values)=
### Default VLAN Values

VLAN definitions without **id** or **vni** attribute will get a VLAN ID or VNI assigned automatically. The first auto-assigned VLAN ID is specified in the **vlan.start_id** global attribute; ID assignment process skips IDs assigned to existing VLANs.

### VLAN Forwarding Modes

VLANs with **mode** set to **bridge** or **irb** are configured as VLAN/SVI interfaces or bridge groups (BVI interfaces or Linux bridge) -- VLAN access or trunk interfaces using the same VLAN are bridged.

VLANs with **mode** set to **route** are configured as routed subinterfaces under the VLAN trunk interface. Access VLAN interfaces with **mode** set to **route** are identical to non-VLAN interfaces.

You can set VLAN forwarding mode within individual links or interfaces with **vlan.mode** attribute, within a node or global **vlans** definition, or with **vlan.mode** node- or global parameter.

The precedence of various **vlan.mode** parameters (from highest to lowest) is as follows:

* Interface **vlan.mode**, potentially inherited from parent interface **vlan.mode** or from parent interface **vlan.trunk** dictionary.
* Link **vlan.mode**, potentially inherited from parent link **vlan.trunk** dictionary
* **mode** set in node **vlans** definition
* Node **vlan.mode** setting[^NVM]
* **mode** set in global **vlans** definition
* Global **vlan.mode** setting

The default forwarding mode is **irb**.

[^NVM]: Node setting takes precedence over global VLAN setting to allow you to attach a router to a VLAN trunk without setting too many parameters.

(module-vlan-interface)=
## Using VLANs on Interfaces and Links

To use a VLAN on a link, add **vlan** dictionary to a link or an interface on a link. The VLAN dictionary may contain the following attributes:

* **access** -- the name of access VLAN configured on the link or interface
* **trunk** -- a list or dictionary of VLANs configured on a trunk port -- see [](module-vlan-trunk-attributes) for more details.
* **native** -- the name of native VLAN configured on a trunk port
* **mode** -- the default VLAN forwarding mode (route/bridge/irb) for this link or interface -- overrides the node- or global forwarding mode

### Access VLAN Restrictions

To keep the VLAN complexity manageable, the VLAN configuration module enforces these rules:

* Access VLAN defined with link **vlan.access** attribute applies to every attached node that uses **vlan** configuration module.
* Access VLANs defined with interface **vlan.access** attribute on multiple nodes attached to the same link must match (you cannot change access VLAN numbers on the same physical segment).
* An access VLAN used by more than one node attached to a physical link must be defined in global **vlans** dictionary to ensure the same VLAN parameters (in particular the IPv4/IPv6 subnets) apply to all nodes using the VLAN.

### Trunk VLAN Restrictions

VLAN configuration module enforces these rules:

* VLANs listed within a **vlan.trunk** attribute must be defined as global VLANs.
* Native VLAN specified in **vlan.native** must be included in **vlan.trunk** list.
* Native VLAN must match across all VLAN-capable nodes connected to a link.

(module-vlan-creating-interfaces)=
## Creating VLAN Interfaces and Routed Subinterfaces

VLAN interfaces and subinterfaces are created on-demand based on these rules:

* A VLAN/SVI/BVI interface is created for every VLAN with **mode** set to *bridge* or *irb* present on a node.
* VLAN subinterfaces are created on VLAN trunks on platforms behaving more like routers than switches (example: Cisco IOS).
* A routed VLAN subinterface is created on every interface that has a VLAN with **mode** set to *route*.
* Routed VLAN subinterfaces are not created for access VLAN interfaces (VLAN specified in **vlan.access** attribute) when the VLAN **mode** is set to *route*. There is no difference between routed access VLAN interface and an interface without VLAN configuration.

The VLAN **mode** can be set in global- or node **vlans** dictionary or with the **vlan.mode** interface/link attribute.

### VLAN Interface Parameters

You can change VLAN interface[^VLANIF] parameters within the node **vlans** dictionary. For example, use the following definitions to set the OSPF cost for the **red** VLAN interface on node **s1**:

[^VLANIF]: VLAN/SVI/BVI interfaces or router VLAN subinterfaces

```
vlans:
  red:

nodes:
  s1:
    module: [ ospf,vlan ]
    vlans:
      red:
        ospf.cost: 10

links:
- s1:
    vlan.access: red
  ...
```

You can also set interface parameters for every interface connected to a VLAN within global VLAN definition. For example, you could set the OSPF cost for all interfaces connected to the **red** VLAN:

```
vlans:
  red:
    ospf.cost: 10

nodes:
  s1:
    module: [ ospf,vlan ]

links:
- s1:
    vlan.access: red
  ...
```

Finally, you can set the parameters of an individual routed VLAN subinterface within the **vlan.trunk** link- or interface- dictionary.

```{warning}
Don't try to set VLAN interface parameters on access or trunk links; you might get unexpected results.
```

(module-vlan-trunk-attributes)=
### Modifying Attributes of VLANs in a VLAN Trunk

Use a list of VLANs in a **vlan.trunk** attribute when you don't want to change individual VLAN attributes on a link/interface level. Use a **vlan.trunk** dictionary when you want to set additional parameters for the virtual links created for individual VLAN in the trunk.

You could use this functionality to set VLAN forwarding mode (**vlan.mode**) on individual VLANs in a trunk[^NMT], or to set parameters for a routed VLAN subinterface.

```{warning}
Use interface- or link attributes within the **‌trunk** dictionary only on routed VLAN subinterfaces. Attributes for VLAN/SVI interfaces should be set within global or node-level **‌vlans** definition.
```

For example, to set OSPF cost for a routed subinterface for VLAN *red* without changing the OSPF cost for *blue* or *green* VLAN, use this link definition:

```
links:
- r1:
    vlan.trunk:
      red:
        vlan.mode: route
        ospf.cost: 10
  s1:
  vlan.trunk: [ red, green, blue ]
```

[^NMT]: Some platforms do not support a mix of bridged and routed VLANs on a single physical interface.

### Physical Interface and VLAN Interface Addressing

IPv4 and/or IPv6 prefixes are automatically assigned to VLAN-enabled links:

* A VLAN is treated like a multi-access link with an IPv4/IPv6 prefix, and gets an addressing prefix assigned from the corresponding address pool if needed.
* If all nodes connected to an access VLAN interface or a VLAN virtual link (see below) use forwarding mode *route*, the link is treated as a regular link, and gets its IP prefix from the corresponding access pool. You can also specify link prefix with the **prefix** attribute. Nodes attached to that link (or VLAN trunk) get their IP addresses from the link prefix.

In all other cases (at least one node attached to a VLAN uses VLAN forwarding mode *irb* or *bridge*):

* VLAN **prefix** is copied into the link (or virtual link) **prefix**.
* All nodes connected to a VLAN get their IP addresses from the VLAN **prefix**. Node addresses within a VLAN prefix are calculated with the algorithm used to calculate IP addresses on multi-access links.
* Whenever a VLAN access interface is attached to a link, the VLAN prefix is used to assign IP addresses to all nodes on that link.
* A VLAN trunk is decomposed into a number of virtual links (one per VLAN). The above rules are then applied to those virtual links.

The following rules are used to assign VLAN IPv4/IPv6 addresses to node interfaces:

* When a node is attached to a VLAN-enabled link, but does not have a **vlan** interface attribute, the VLAN IP address is assigned to physical interface.
* When the VLAN forwarding mode is set to *irb*, the node VLAN IP address is assigned to a VLAN interface.
* No IP address is assigned to the VLAN interface when the VLAN forwarding mode is set to *bridge*.
* No IP address is assigned to the physical interface that has an **access** or **native** VLAN with **mode** set to *bridge* or *irb*. You can try to force an IP address assignment to such an interface with **ipv4** or **ipv6** interface attribute and become responsible for the results of your actions.
* Interfaces with **access** or **native** VLAN that has **mode** set to *route* are treated like regular interfaces and get IP addresses.
* IP prefixes are not assigned to the physical interfaces with VLAN trunks. If you want to assign IP addresses to default native VLAN (1), use **role** or **prefix** link attribute.
* When the VLAN forwarding mode of a VLAN in a VLAN trunk is set to *route*, the VLAN IP address is  assigned to the routed subinterface (see also [](module-vlan-creating-interfaces)).

(module-vlan-caveats)=
## Known Caveats

If we document them, they're not bugs, right?

* Devices connected to a single-node VLAN will not have VLAN-wide list of neighbors on the interface connected to that node. EBGP sessions that should be configured over that VLAN might be missing.
