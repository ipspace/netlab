# OSPF Configuration Module

This configuration module configures OSPF routing process on Cisco IOS, Cisco Nexus-OS, Arista EOS, Junos, and ArcOS.

Supported features:

* Multi-area deployment
* Per-link cost and asymmetric costs
* Reference bandwidth
* Unnumbered point-to-point interfaces
* Passive interfaces

## Global Parameters

* **ospf.reference_bandwidth** sets the OSPF auto-cost reference bandwidth (in Mbps) for all devices in the network.

## Node Parameters

* **ospf.process** -- process ID (default: 1)
* **ospf.area** -- default OSPF area (default: 0.0.0.0). Used on links without explicit OSPF area, and on loopback interface.
* **ospf.reference_bandwidth** -- per-node OSPF auto-cost reference bandwidth (in Mbps).

You can specify node parameters as global values (top-level topology elements) or within individual nodes (see [example](#example) for details).

## Link Parameters

* **ospf.cost** -- OSPF cost
* **ospf.area** -- OSPF area. Use on ABRs; node-level OSPF area is recommended for intra-area routers.

**Note:** the same parameters can be specified for individual link nodes.

## Other Parameters

Link type is used to set OSPF network type:

* *P2P link* ⇒ **point-to-point** network
* Any other link type ⇒ **broadcast** network
* *Stub link* ⇒ passive interface

Stub links must have exactly one device attached to them. To create multi-router stub links, use **role: stub** link attribute (see below).

## Using Link Roles

Link roles are used together with link types to decide whether to include an interface in an OSPF process, and whether to make an interface passive:

* External links (links with **role: external**) are not included in the OSPF process. 
* Links with **role** set to **stub** or **passive** are configured as *passive* OSPF interfaces.

**Notes:** 

* Link role could be set by the BGP module -- links with devices from different AS numbers attached to them get a role specified in **defaults.bgp.ebgp_role** parameter. The system default value of that parameter is **external**, making inter-AS links excluded from the OSPF process.
* Management interfaces are never added to the OSPF process. They are not in the set of device links and thus not considered in the OSPF configuration template.

## Example

We want to create a three-router multi-area OSPF network:

* R1 is a backbone area router
* R2 is ABR between backbone area and area 1
* R3 is in intra-area router in area 1.

All devices run OSPF:
```
module: [ ospf ]
```

Default OSPF area is 0.0.0.0:
```
ospf:
  area: 0.0.0.0
```

R1 and R2 are in default OSPF area (no need to specify per-node area):

```
nodes:
  r1:
    device: iosv
  r2:
    device: eos
```

R3 is in area 1. Non-default OSPF area must be specified within node data:

```
nodes:
  r3:
    device: nxos
    ospf:
      area: 0.0.0.1
```

Link between R1 and R2 is in area 0. No need to specify per-link area:

```
links:
- r1:
  r2:
```

Link between R2 and R3 is in area 1. Specify OSPF area within link definition:

```
links:
- r2:
  r3:
  ospf:
    area: 0.0.0.1
```

Alternatively, you could specify the OSPF area just for R2 (as R3 is already in area 1):

```
links:
- r2:
    ospf:
      area: 0.0.0.1
  r3:
```

**Interesting details**: 

* The default value for interface OSPF area is the node OSPF area (specified in configuration template).
* The default value for node OSPF area is the global OSPF area.
* Due to the propagation of default values, the OSPF area for R2-R3 link would be area 0 on R2 and area 1 on R3. The OSPF area thus needs to be specified within link definition, or within an individual node connected to a link.

### Resulting Device Configurations

The above topology generates the following device configurations

#### R1 (Cisco IOS)

```

!
interface Loopback0
 ip ospf 1 area 0.0.0.0
!

```

#### R2 (Arista EOS)

```
