# Building a Cisco Catalyst 8000v Vagrant Libvirt Box

Cisco Catalyst 8000v is supported by the **netlab libvirt package** command. To build a **cat8000v** box:

* Create an empty directory on a Ubuntu machine with *libvirt* and *Vagrant*.
* Download a Catalyst 8000v disk image (.qcow2 file) with `serial` in the file name (example: `c8000v-universalk9_8G_serial.17.13.01a.qcow2`) into that directory
* Execute **netlab libvirt package cat8000v _virtual-disk-file-name_** and follow the instructions

## Initial Device Configuration

The initial configuration is automatically applied to the device during the box-building process. However, you might want to verify it before proceeding:

```{eval-rst}
.. include:: cat8000v.txt
   :literal:
```
