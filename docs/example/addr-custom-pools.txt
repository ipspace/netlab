## Customize Address Pools

Don't like the built-in addressing rules? It's extremely easy to:

* Change built-in address pools
* Define your own pools
* Use user-defined pools on individual links

### Change Built-In Address Pools

All *netlab* [address pools](../addressing.md) are defined in the **addressing** section of lab topology file. The default value of that section (taken from system defaults) is:

```
addressing:
  l2only: {}
  lan:
    ipv4: 172.16.0.0/16
    prefix: 24
  loopback:
    ipv4: 10.0.0.0/24
    prefix: 32
  mgmt:
    ipv4: 192.168.121.0/24
    mac: 08-4F-A9-00-00-00
    prefix: 24
    start: 100
  p2p:
    ipv4: 10.1.0.0/16
    prefix: 30
  vrf_loopback:
    ipv4: 10.2.0.0/24
    prefix: 32
```

```{tip}
To display address pools used by your lab topology, use `netlab create -o yaml:addressing` command.
```

To change the system defaults, specify **addressing** section in your lab topology. [System defaults are always deep-merged with topology file settings](../defaults.md), allowing you to specify just the changes you want to make.

For example, to use default AWS CIDR block for LAN segments, specify **addressing.lan.ipv4** parameter:

```
addressing.lan.ipv4: 172.31.0.0/16
```

Obviously you could use the more traditional dictionary hierarchy if you prefer longer YAML files:

```
addressing:
  lan:
    ipv4: 172.31.0.0/16
```

Likewise, it takes a single line to change the default IPv4 prefix size of point-to-point address pools to /28:

```
addressing.p2p.prefix: 28
```

### Select an Address Pool for a Link

**role** link attribute is all you need to override the default pool selection logic. The **role** attribute can be used as a generic tag to help you write custom configuration templates. For example, you could write a custom template that would set OSPF area to 0.0.0.0 on all links with **role: core**.

However, if the link **role** happens to match an address pool name, that pool will be used to allocate a prefix to the link. To create a point-to-point link that uses a prefix from the LAN pool, use the following link definition:

```
nodes: [ r1, r2 ]
links:
- r1:
  r2:
  role: lan
```

The resulting link data structure is interesting:

* It contains all attributes one would expect to see on a point-to-point link
* The nodes connected to the link get the first and the second IP address from the link prefix (due to point-to-point address allocation rules)
* The IP prefix and the subnet size belong to the LAN pool (due to **role** attribute).

```
links:
- interfaces:
  - ipv4: 172.16.0.1/24
    node: r1
  - ipv4: 172.16.0.2/24
    node: r2
  left:
    ifname: eth1
    ipv4: 172.16.0.1/24
    node: r1
  linkindex: 1
  name: r1 - r2
  node_count: 2
  prefix:
    ipv4: 172.16.0.0/24
  right:
    ifname: eth1
    ipv4: 172.16.0.2/24
    node: r2
  role: lan
  type: p2p
```

### Layer-2-Only Links Using l2only Address Pool

A more interesting case of selecting built-in address pools with **role** attribute is layer-2-only links -- when a link **role** is set to **l2only**, the link gets no IP prefix and the interfaces attached to the link have no IP addresses.

You could build a simple bridged network with this lab topology:

```
nodes: [ r1, r2 ]
links:
- r1:
  r2:
  role: l2only
```

The resulting link data structure contains no IP addresses:

```
links:
  - interfaces:
      - node: r1
      - node: r2
    left:
      ifname: eth1
      node: r1
    linkindex: 1
    name: r1 - r2
    node_count: 2
    right:
      ifname: eth1
      node: r2
    role: l2only
    type: p2p
```

Similarly, the node data for R1 (what you'd find in Ansible inventory **host_vars** for R1) has no IP addresses apart from loopback and management ones:

```
box: none
device: none
id: 1
interfaces:
  - ifindex: 1
    ifname: eth1
    linkindex: 1
    name: r1 -> r2
    neighbors:
      - ifname: eth1
        node: r2
    remote_id: 2
    remote_ifindex: 1
    role: l2only
    type: p2p
loopback:
  ipv4: 10.0.0.1/32
mgmt:
  ifname: eth0
  ipv4: 192.168.121.101
  mac: 08-4F-A9-00-00-01
name: r1
```

### Custom Address Pools

To specify custom address pools, add keys to **addressing** dictionary, for example:

```
addressing:
  core:
    ipv4: 10.2.0.0/16
    prefix: 28
```

To use the **core** address pool, set link **role** to **core**, for example:

```
nodes: [ r1, r2 ]
links:
- r1:
  r2:
  role: core
```

You'll find more details in [Topology Address Pools](../addressing.md) document.
