## Customize Address Pools

If you don't like the built-in addressing rules, it's extremely easy to:

* Change built-in address pools
* Define additional address pools
* Use user-defined pools on individual links

### Change Built-In Address Pools

All *netlab* [address pools](../addressing.md) are defined in the **addressing** section of the lab topology file. The default value of that section (taken from system defaults) is:

```
addressing:
  l2only: {}
  lan:
    ipv4: 172.16.0.0/16
    prefix: 24
  loopback:
    ipv4: 10.0.0.0/24
    prefix: 32
  mgmt:
    ipv4: 192.168.121.0/24
    mac: 08-4F-A9-00-00-00
    prefix: 24
    start: 100
  p2p:
    ipv4: 10.1.0.0/16
    prefix: 30
  vrf_loopback:
    ipv4: 10.2.0.0/24
    prefix: 32
```

```{tip}
To display address pools used by your lab topology, use the `netlab create -o yaml:addressing` command.
```

To change the system defaults, specify the **addressing** section in your lab topology. [System defaults are always deep-merged with topology file settings](../defaults.md), allowing you to specify only the changes you want to make.

For example, to use the default AWS CIDR block for LAN segments, specify **addressing.lan.ipv4** parameter:

```
addressing.lan.ipv4: 172.31.0.0/16
```

You could also use the more traditional dictionary hierarchy if you prefer longer YAML files:

```
addressing:
  lan:
    ipv4: 172.31.0.0/16
```

Likewise, it takes a single line to change the default IPv4 prefix size of point-to-point address pools to /28:

```
addressing.p2p.prefix: 28
```

### Select an Address Pool for a Link

**pool** link attribute is all you need to override the default pool selection logic. For example, to create a point-to-point link that uses a prefix from the LAN pool, use the following link definition:

```
nodes: [ r1, r2 ]
links:
- r1:
  r2:
  pool: lan
```

The resulting link data structure is interesting:

* It contains all attributes one would expect to see on a point-to-point link
* The nodes connected to the link get the first and the second IP address from the link prefix (due to point-to-point address allocation rules)
* The IP prefix and the subnet size belong to the LAN pool (due to the **pool** attribute).

```
links:
- interfaces:
  - ipv4: 172.16.0.1/24
    node: r1
  - ipv4: 172.16.0.2/24
    node: r2
  linkindex: 1
  name: r1 - r2
  node_count: 2
  pool: lan
  prefix:
    ipv4: 172.16.0.0/24
  type: p2p
```

### Layer-2-Only Links Using l2only Address Pool

A more interesting case of selecting built-in address pools with **pool** attribute is layer-2-only links -- when a link **pool** is set to **l2only**, the link gets no IP prefix, and the interfaces attached to the link have no IP addresses.

```{warning}
Creating an interface without IPv4/IPv6 addresses does not imply a bridged interface. To bridge multiple interfaces, use the [VLAN module](module-vlan).

A reasonable use case for the **â€Œl2only** pool is a custom layer-2 functionality implemented in [your configuration template](custom-config). You can also try to use it to implement CLNS-only IS-IS networks ;)
```

This is how you could build a layer-2 network (you would also have to use a custom configuration template to provide whatever layer-2 services you wish):

```
nodes: [ r1, r2 ]
links:
- r1:
  r2:
  pool: l2only
```

The resulting link data structure contains no IP addresses:

```
links:
- interfaces:
  - ifindex: 1
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
    node: r1
  - ifindex: 1
    ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
    node: r2
  linkindex: 1
  node_count: 2
  pool: l2only
  type: p2p
```

Similarly, the node data for R1 (what you'd find in Ansible inventory **host_vars** for R1) has no IP addresses apart from loopback and management ones:

```
af:
  ipv4: true
box: cisco/iosv
device: iosv
id: 1
interfaces:
- ifindex: 1
  ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
  linkindex: 1
  name: r1 -> r2
  neighbors:
  - ifname: GigabitEthernet0/1
    node: r2
  pool: l2only
  type: p2p
loopback:
  ipv4: 10.0.0.1/32
mgmt:
  ifname: GigabitEthernet0/0
  ipv4: 192.168.121.101
  mac: 08-4F-A9-00-00-01
name: r1
```

### Custom Address Pools

To specify custom address pools, add keys to the **addressing** dictionary, for example:

```
addressing:
  core:
    ipv4: 10.2.0.0/16
    prefix: 28
```

To use the **core** address pool, set link **pool** to **core**, for example:

```
nodes: [ r1, r2 ]
links:
- r1:
  r2:
  pool: core
```

Read the [Topology Address Pools](address-pools) document for more details.
