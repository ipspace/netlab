[r2_eth1_down]     Remove R2 from the VRRP LAN [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet ifdown
[PASS]             R2 has been disconnected from the VRRP LAN

[ping_vrrp]        Verify VRRP is enabled on DUT [ node(s): h1 ]
[PASS]             h1: Ping to h2 succeeded
[PASS]             Test succeeded

[r2_eth1_up]       Add R2 to the VRRP LAN [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet ifdown
[PASS]             R2 has been reconnected to the VRRP LAN

[r2_vrrp_backup]   Verify that R2 is in the backup state [ node(s): r2 ]
[PASS]             Validation succeeded on r2
[PASS]             Test succeeded

[r2_vrrp_prio]     Starting test [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet vrrp-priority
[PASS]             R2 VRRP priority has been increased to 80

[r2_vrrp_master]   Verify that R2 took over as master (VRRP priority on DUT is lower than 80) [ node(s): r2 ]
[PASS]             Validation succeeded on r2
[PASS]             Test succeeded

[r2_vrrp_prio_low] Starting test [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet vrrp-priority
[PASS]             R2 VRRP priority has been lowered to 20

[dut_preempt]      Verify that DUT preempts R2 when its priority is lowered [ node(s): r2 ]
[WARNING]          Node r2: Test failed for node r2
