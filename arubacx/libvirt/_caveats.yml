  05-gtsm:
    caveat: |
      Initially, Aruba CX sends EBGP packets with TTL=64 and starts sending packets
      with TTL=255 after the validation test has already timed out (~4 minutes).
evpn:
  04-vxlan-central-routing:
    caveat: |
      Aruba CX core router doing VXLAN-to-VXLAN routing does not interoperate with
      Linux-based edge switches doing VXLAN-to-VLAN bridging. It does work with
      Arista cEOS and Cisco Nexu OS devices as edge switches.
  20-vxlan-irb-ospf:
    caveat: |
      Aruba CX does not propagate CPU-generated traffic over VXLAN in IRB scenarios,
      making it impossible to establish VRF OSPF adjacency across a VXLAN link.

    20-default: 
      caveat: |
        Aruba CX cannot specify the OSPF external route type on the default route. All
        default routes are advertised as E2 routes.

      caveat: |
        Aruba CX cannot specify the OSPF external route type on the default route. All
        default routes are advertised as E2 routes.
routing:
  22-static-inter-vrf:
    caveat: |
      Aruba CX does not support IPv6 routes with interface and next-hop information,
      making them useless for inter-VRF static routing.
