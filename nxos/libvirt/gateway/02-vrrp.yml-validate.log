[PASS]             Test succeeded in 1.1 seconds

[ping_vrrp_v6]     Verify VRRP for IPv6 is enabled on DUT [ node(s): h1 ]
[PASS]             h1: Ping to ipv6 h2 succeeded
[PASS]             Test succeeded in 1.1 seconds

[r2_vrrp_up]       Enable VRRP or R2 [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet ifdown
[PASS]             VRRP has been reenabled on R2

[r2_vrrp_backup]   Verify that R2 is in the backup state [ node(s): r2 ]
[PASS]             Validation succeeded on r2
[PASS]             Test succeeded in 0.2 seconds

[r2_vrrp_prio]     Starting test [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet vrrp-priority
[PASS]             R2 VRRP priority has been increased to 80

[r2_vrrp_master]   Verify that R2 took over as master (VRRP priority on DUT is lower than 80) [ node(s): r2 ]
