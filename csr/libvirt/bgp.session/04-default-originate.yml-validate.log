Warning in cli: Lab topology source file /home/pipi/net101/tools/tests/integration/bgp.session/04-default-originate.yml has been modified
... after the snapshot netlab.snapshot.yml has been created

    (including lab topology or defaults) are not automatically reflected in the snapshot
    file. Use 'netlab create' or 'netlab up' to create a new snapshot file.
