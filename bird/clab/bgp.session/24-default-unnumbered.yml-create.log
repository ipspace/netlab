Errors encountered while processing 24-default-unnumbered.yml
IncorrectValue in bgp: dut (device bird) does not support EBGP sessions over auto-generated IPv6 LLA (interface dut -> x1)
MissingValue in routing: Host dut is attached only to subnets where all routers have unnumbered interfaces
... Set defaults.routing.warnings.host_gw to False to disable this check
... Hosts attached to routers need a shared gateway or a gateway of last resort. In both
    cases, at least one adjacent router needs a real (not unnumbered/LLA) IP address.
