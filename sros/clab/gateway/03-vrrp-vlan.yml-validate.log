[r2_no_vrrp]   Disable VRRP on R2 [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]         Executing configuration snippet ifdown with ifidx=-1 ifstate=down
[PASS]         VRRP has been disabled on R2

[ping_vrrp_v4] Verify VRRP for IPv4 is enabled on DUT (also: wait for STP) [ node(s): h1 ]
[PASS]         h1: Ping to ipv4 h2 (172.16.44.4) succeeded
[PASS]         Test succeeded in 12.4 seconds

[ping_vrrp_v6] Verify VRRP for IPv6 is enabled on DUT [ node(s): h1 ]
[PASS]         h1: Ping to ipv6 h2 succeeded
[PASS]         Test succeeded in 0.1 seconds

[r2_vrrp_up]   Enable VRRP or R2 [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]         Executing configuration snippet ifdown with ifidx=-1 ifstate=up
[PASS]         VRRP has been reenabled on R2

[r2_v4_backup] Verify that R2 is in the backup state for IPv4 [ node(s): r2 ]
[PASS]         Validation succeeded on r2
[PASS]         Test succeeded in 0.2 seconds

[r2_v6_backup] Verify that R2 is in the backup state for IPv6 [ node(s): r2 ]
[PASS]         Validation succeeded on r2
[PASS]         Test succeeded in 0.2 seconds

[r2_prio_high] Starting test [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]         Executing configuration snippet vrrp-priority with ifidx=-1 vrrp_prio=80
[PASS]         R2 VRRP priority has been increased to 80

[r2_v4_master] Verify that R2 took over as master on IPv4 (VRRP priority on DUT is lower than 80) [ node(s): r2 ]
[PASS]         Validation succeeded on r2
[PASS]         Test succeeded in 0.2 seconds

[r2_v6_master] Verify that R2 took over as master on IPv6 (VRRP priority on DUT is lower than 80) [ node(s): r2 ]
[PASS]         Validation succeeded on r2
[PASS]         Test succeeded in 2.7 seconds

[r2_prio_low]  Starting test [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]         Executing configuration snippet vrrp-priority with ifidx=-1 vrrp_prio=20
[PASS]         R2 VRRP priority has been lowered to 20

[preempt_v4]   Verify that DUT preempts R2 when its priority is lowered [ node(s): r2 ]
