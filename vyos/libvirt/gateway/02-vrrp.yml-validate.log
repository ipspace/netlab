Warning in cli: Lab topology source file /home/pipi/net101/tools/tests/integration/gateway/02-vrrp.yml has been modified
... after the snapshot netlab.snapshot.yml has been created
... Set defaults.warnings.snapshot.modified to False to hide this warning
... netlab transforms lab topology into device- and platform data and stores the results
    in a snapshot file that is used by most netlab commands. Changes to source files
    (including lab topology or defaults) are not automatically reflected in the snapshot
    file. Use 'netlab create' or 'netlab up' to create a new snapshot file.
[r2_eth1_down]     Remove R2 from the VRRP LAN [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet ifdown
[PASS]             R2 has been disconnected from the VRRP LAN

[ping_vrrp]        Verify VRRP is enabled on DUT [ node(s): h1 ]
[PASS]             h1: Ping to h2 succeeded
[PASS]             Test succeeded in 0.1 seconds

[r2_eth1_up]       Add R2 to the VRRP LAN [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet ifdown
[PASS]             R2 has been reconnected to the VRRP LAN

[r2_vrrp_backup]   Verify that R2 is in the backup state [ node(s): r2 ]
[PASS]             Validation succeeded on r2
[PASS]             Test succeeded in 0.2 seconds

[r2_vrrp_prio]     Starting test [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet vrrp-priority
[PASS]             R2 VRRP priority has been increased to 80

[r2_vrrp_master]   Verify that R2 took over as master (VRRP priority on DUT is lower than 80) [ node(s): r2 ]
[PASS]             Validation succeeded on r2
[PASS]             Test succeeded in 0.2 seconds

[r2_vrrp_prio_low] Starting test [ node(s): r2 ]
[INFO]             Executing configuration snippet vrrp-priority
[PASS]             R2 VRRP priority has been lowered to 20

[dut_preempt]      Verify that DUT preempts R2 when its priority is lowered [ node(s): r2 ]
[WARNING]          Node r2: Test failed for node r2
