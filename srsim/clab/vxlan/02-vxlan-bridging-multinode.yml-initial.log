This is the multi-node version of the vxlan-bridging lab.
Use it to check that you don't have spanning tree problems
in VXLAN overlay

* h1, h2 and h3 should be able to ping each other
* h4, h5 and h6 should be able to ping each other

Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
OSPF adjacency establishment and STP learning phase
