This scenario tests the basic "bridge" functionality. As a "bridge" is nothing
more than a VLAN-capable node having all interfaces in VLAN 1, this test
effectively:

* Tests whether the device can take the role 'bridge'
* Whether the interfaces are all configured in the same VLAN
* Whether the device configuration template handles VLAN 1, or the device
  quirks take extra efforts to work around that
