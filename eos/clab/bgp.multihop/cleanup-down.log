Warning in cli: Lab topology source file /home/pipi/net101/tools/tests/integration/bgp.multihop/02-vrf.yml has been modified

... Set defaults.warnings.snapshot.modified to False to hide this warning
... netlab transforms lab topology into device- and platform data and stores the results
    in a snapshot file that is used by most netlab commands. Changes to source files
    (including lab topology or defaults) are not automatically reflected in the snapshot
    file. Use 'netlab create' or 'netlab up' to create a new snapshot file.
